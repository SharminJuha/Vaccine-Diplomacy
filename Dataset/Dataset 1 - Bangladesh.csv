On December 31 2019, the first case of COVID-19 was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), and the source of the outbreak was linked to a wet market in Wuhan city, China. Shortly cases of the virus have been confirmed in numerous countries and territories worldwide, and on 30th January 2020, WHO declared the novel coronavirus outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). [1] The rate of spread and transmission was so rapid that within a month, the first three confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Bangladesh. On 8 March 2020, two of the infected individuals who have recently returned from Italy and the third patient was a family member of one of the travelers were reported to be hospitalized with the virus. All three individuals were Bangladeshi nationals. [2]

Bangladesh’s COVID-19 Scenario at a Glimpse 
According to the World Health Organization, Bangladesh has reported 802,305 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 12,660 deaths from 3rd January 2020 to 2nd June, 2021. [3] Subsequently, 738,805 people recovered from the disease with a recovery rate of 92.5% (as of 31st May, 2021). In Bangladesh, a countrywide COVID-19 vaccination drive kicked off on February 7 and initially, the minimum age for COVID-19 vaccination was 40. [6]   Bangladesh started administering the second dose of coronavirus vaccine from 8th April 2021, while continuing to give the first shot to citizens who have registered. [7]

Importance of Vaccine Diplomacy in Bangladesh
Bangladesh needs to make “vaccine diplomacy” as a part of its strategy
To be among the first counties to procure an effective vaccine, Bangladesh should deal with both China and India briskly with an “open to all policy” approach alongside maintaining contact with all the potential vaccine-producing countries. Due to the complexity of international politics, it could be difficult to procure vaccines solely based on bilateral relations. Subsequently, economic diplomacy will also play a significant role while making decisions related to vaccine procurement. Bangladesh, with its large population, is undoubtedly a major market for vaccine makers, which may be used as a bargaining tool during negotiations. [8] Due to geopolitical interest, China and India have already assured Bangladesh of giving priority to providing their vaccines, and China’s offer for the trial of its vaccine is already accepted in Bangladesh.

Nevertheless, it might be challenging to receive doses from China and India in due time since both countries have huge domestic demand due to their large population size. Hence, vaccine diplomacy should be a part of our strategy and we should aim to secure permission for manufacturing any vaccine in our country to ensure its availability here in due time.",https://www.lightcastlebd.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/vaccine-image.jpeg,"June 10, 2021",LightcastleBD,Vaccine Diplomacy and its Significance in Bangladesh,
2022/0003,Article,https://thediplomat.com/2021/08/china-swoops-into-bangladesh-with-a-vaccine-deal/,"On August 17, the Bangladeshi government signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China’s Sinopharm and Bangladesh’s Incepta Vaccines Ltd. under which the local vaccine manufacturer would produce 5 million export-quality Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine doses per month. The deal is a significant one. Not only will it help Bangladesh address its vaccine shortage but also with this, China has made deeper inroads into the South Asian country. It kept a low profile and bided its time, and when opportunity opened up, it acted swiftly to strike the vaccine deal with the Bangladesh government.

China has strong ties with Bangladesh. It has been Dhaka’s biggest partner in infrastructure building over much of the past decade and has funded and implemented multi-million dollar projects in Bangladesh.

Still, the Bangladesh government has adopted a cautious approach toward China.

It blacklisted China Harbor and Engineering Company for attempting to bribe officials and rolled back a $1.6 billion highway project. Out of the 27 MoUs signed in 2016 between the two countries as part of the Belt Road Initiative, only five were implemented until 2019. In 2020, China agreed to invest approximately $7 billion in nine big infrastructure projects but Dhaka has received only $1 billion so far.Bangladesh has a history of being financially prudent. It is careful with borrowing as it is keen to avoid being drawn into a debt trap. In effect, it has thwarted a powerful tool of diplomatic coercion that China has wielded against its economic partners.Underlying Dhaka’s cautious economic engagement with Beijing is a deep-rooted fear that it could go Sri Lanka’s way and fall into a debt trap. Hence, its extreme caution in getting into deals with China.

Beijing fully understands that it can only go so far with Dhaka, and has therefore resorted to building sustainable “secondary” regional frameworks to court Bangladesh, like the China-South Asia Emergency Supplies Reserve and Poverty Alleviation and Cooperative Development Center. Meanwhile, it waits for the “opportune moment.”

In Bangladesh, Beijing has realized that it cannot expect foreign policy success without respecting Bangladesh’s sovereignty and its right to conduct its international politics in the way it wants to.

In May this year, Chinese Ambassador to Dhaka Li Jiming warned Bangladesh against joining the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the Quad. Joining this “club” would “substantially damage” Sino-Bangladesh relations, he said.

Bangladesh responded swiftly. Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen reminded China that Bangladesh is “an independent and sovereign country” that sets its own foreign policy. China was “overstepping” its limits by “trying to dictate what we should or should not do.”

China, which does not take reprimand or criticism lightly, remained silent in response to Momen’s comment. So why did Beijing retreat? The answer is India.

Bangladesh has strong relations with India. The two countries worked together during the 1971 liberation war. In addition to cultural and kinship ties, the two are cooperating in an array of fields including counterterrorism cooperation.

An observation made by Momen last year on the nature of the bilateral bond captures the nature of the India-Bangladesh cooperation. Bangladesh shares “blood ties” with India, he said, pointing out that with China, Dhaka’s relationship is purely economic. The two cannot be compared, Momen said.

China’s “wolf warrior diplomacy,” its aggressive positions on geopolitical issues and attempts at territorial expansion seem to indicate that Beijing is moving away from Deng Xiaoping’s “tao guang yang hui” (translates to “leave brightness, embrace obscurity”) philosophy of international conduct.

However, a close look at Sino-Bangladesh relations points to a different story. Indeed it suggests that many experts may have got “tao guang yang hui” wrong.Former Chinese diplomat Yang Wenchang once wrote that “tao guang yang hui” is deeply rooted in Chinese culture and refers to low-profile behavior, cool-headedness, intricate planning, and hard work. Wenchang also said that it defines China’s strategic thinking where diplomats are calm, attentively observe global changes, and prepare to seize any opportunities that might arise to further the country’s far-sighted goals. Wenchang’s interpretation of “tao guang yang hui” provides context to China’s engagement of Bangladesh.

China did not react too aggressively to Bangladesh’s cancellation of BRI projects or the Bangladeshi foreign minister’s reprimand. Rather, it kept quiet and bided its time.

In due course, opportunity opened up when India halted vaccine exports in March this year to meet domestic demands for vaccines at the height of its second COVID-19 wave.

Although India and Bangladesh had signed an agreement under which India was to supply the latter with 30 million vaccine doses by mid-2021 it received only 9 million doses, before India abruptly stopped exporting vaccines.

The move not only jeopardized the lives of nearly 1.5 million Bangladeshis who had received their first jab but also, it brought to a halt Bangladesh’s mass vaccination campaign that began even before Canada and the European Union procured any vaccines.

Dhaka repeatedly requested India to provide it with at least enough vaccines to administer the second dose to its people. But its requests fell on deaf ears in India.

It was at this point that China swooped in. It swiftly offered 100,000 vaccine doses as a gift with an option to purchase more. Since March, Bangladesh has received 9 million Sinopharm doses from China, with an additional 1.1 million doses as a gift. Dhaka resumed its countrywide vaccine from July while simultaneously agreeing to procure a total of 60 million Sinopharm vaccines.

Meanwhile, the United States and Japan are trying to match China’s growing vaccine diplomacy. The U.S. has decided to send both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to Bangladesh. Until now, Dhaka has received roughly 5.5 million doses from the U.S. as a gift, with 6 million more promised to be delivered by December this year under the World Health Origanization-led COVAX initiative.

Bangladesh has also received 1.6 million AstraZeneca doses from Japan under COVAX, with another roughly 1.5 million doses due for delivery.",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sizes/medium/thediplomat_2021-08-13-1.jpg,"August 22, 2022",THE DIPLOMAT,China Swoops Into Bangladesh With a Vaccine Deal,

Besides, Bangladesh has a good track record of vaccine utilisation which also contributed to getting more vaccines under Covax. 

Top Covax donor-funded dose recipients are Bangladesh 133.06 million, Indonesia 87.95 million, Pakistan 77.16 million, Philippines 65.14 million, Nigeria 60.07 million, Egypt 54.22 million, Vietnam 49.61 million, Uganda 30.92 million, Nepal 22.93 million and Ethiopia 22.46 million.

Overall, some 9.8 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered around the world. Covax jabs account for 82% of injections in the 91 poorest economies.

Professor Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, chair of the Covid-19 Vaccine Management Taskforce Committee of the Directorate General of the Health Services told The Business Standard that the whole team of the government worked jointly to get the Covid-19 vaccines. 

""When we faced a vaccine shortage, all the missions of the government, health and foreign ministry along with other ministries started negotiations to arrange Covid vaccine which is now coming under Covax facilities. No single person should be given credit,"" she said.In Bangladesh, 9.24 crore people have received the first dose of coronavirus vaccine, 5.83 crore people received two doses and 10 lakh people got booster doses till Saturday.

The inoculation programme faced a hiccup only after a few months in the beginning due to a shortage of vaccines. But Bangladesh now has adequate vaccine stock overcoming that situation.  

Health Minister Zahid Maleque Friday said at a press briefing that the government has a stock of nine crore doses of vaccines. The government will administer vaccines to 70% of its population or 12 crores as per the target. 

People now are more interested than before to take Covid jabs and the government's campaign for the special vaccination programme bore results. There is a record of administering 70 lakh doses in a single day through the special campaign.

Professor Meerjady Sabrina Flora, also additional director general (planning and development) of DGHS, said that Covax vaccines are given to the countries based on the utilisation rate. Bangladesh has done well in vaccine utilisation, which is also a reason for getting more vaccines.

Dr ASM Alamgir, Principal Scientific Officer of the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) told TBS that Covax has a target to vaccinate at least 20% of the population of the member states. But Bangladesh would get vaccines for 40% of its population as the vaccination rate is good. 

But Bangladesh has not yet received the total vaccine consignment for its 20% population which was supposed to reach here by December last year, he said, adding: the volume of donation we received is higher than other countries. The Covax vaccines which arrive in future would be used for booster doses. 

Covax collects vaccines by procuring at a low price or through donation. 

Echoing Professor Sabrina and Dr Alamgir, noted Virologist and Member of the National Technical Advisory Committee On Covid-19 Professor Nazrul Islam said that Bangladesh has fared well in getting Covax vaccines. But the authorities should be careful about vaccine management so that the wastage is minimal.  

""The elderly persons should be brought under vaccination on a priority basis. The process of people's access to vaccines should be made easier,"" he suggested.   

Bangladesh received the first consignment of 1.06 lakh doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine under Covax in June last year followed by Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson and Johnson.  

Professor Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that the target might be changed if necessary. 

""On Sunday there was a meeting with Covax on vaccines. Whenever the World Health Organisation will allow vaccines for children under 12 years, we will start that along with the booster dose programme,"" she said.

2022?0007,Article,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/a-delicate-global-game-1625250804,"Global politics is now familiar with several new words following the outbreak of the ever deadliest Coronavirus pandemic, among which one new term is ""Vaccine Diplomacy."" Diplomacy is an English word, derived from the Greek word ""Diplon,"" which means folding. It is quite conceivable that diplomacy is such a relationship that is traditionally kept in a folder without being opened. To unveil the artifice of diplomacy, Winston Churchill, the erstwhile Premier of England, opined that ""Diplomacy is such an art, by which when you invite someone to make a journey to hell, he will willingly ask you the address to get there."" Diplomacy is a very ancient concept that proceeded at an equal pace with the development of the idea of a state. Vaccine diplomacy is being heard worldwide nowadays. From the humanitarian perspective, many countries have extended a helping hand to the most affected countries. And through this, the amazement of vaccine diplomacy is spreading all along. A few days ago, China and Russia were behind in this diplomacy race. India's race in the vaccine in South Asia was eye-catching. Except for Pakistan, India has given the vaccine to all South Asian countries, to some extent as gifts too. The vaccine diplomacy of India was a hot topic of discussion to others. Suddenly, a topsy-turvy coronavirus situation badly grabs India as the infection cases, and death toll started rising in huge numbers since March 2021 compared to those of other countries of the world. In the meantime, China and Russia have appeared in the steering seat to snap the existing diplomatic field and control the vaccine source. Russia takes the initiative to supply vaccines to 70 countries, while China plans to include 90 countries in its vaccine supply chain.
The Sputnik of Russia, the Sinovac of China, and the Pfizer of the USA, three vaccine manufacturers, are engaged in producing and developing supply channels in and outside the countries. Both Russia and the USA are highly interested in investing in the corona vaccine in India. China is already in talks with South Asian countries. France, Russia, and the USA have already delivered the necessary equipment and tool to India to deal with Covid. Though the USA did not respond immediately to help India at the beginning of its unrestrained corona shock, there was a conflict between the two countries on India's purchase of S-400 missiles from Russia. On the other hand, India's relation with China is critical, and very recently, it deteriorates for joining QUAD (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue). Global politics is quite unpredictable, and it is challenging to assess which country will finally take the lead on a unanimous global issue. A few days ago, the ""AstraZeneca"" covid vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India was considered a soft power to make a strong network with other countries. Now this country is in serious trouble at the national level due to the unprecedented shock by the second wave of Covid. India is now far away from the race to become a world power for the Covid vaccine. To combat Covid, China is the most advanced and successful in dealing with it now. The British daily ""Guardian"" said that the lockdown practice implemented by China was so savage, but it proved worth and effective ultimately. Seemingly China's economy, however, is hardly affected following the ongoing deadliest second wave prevailing in many countries. In terms of Corona diplomacy, China is now on the scene and heading actively towards strengthening corona diplomacy in South Asian countries in the absence of India. Bangladesh has already shown keen interest in manufacturing the vaccine of China and Russia as this country has an in-built infrastructure with existing medicine production plants in many of its pharmaceutical companies. Therefore, it can be forecasted that China and Russia, though competitors to each other, will be advancing in the vaccine business, keeping other parties behind. The United Kingdom and European Union are still lagging behind in vaccine diplomacy with the rest of the world.
China has already formed a ""Storage Platform"" referring to the ""Emergency Vaccination Storage Facility for Covid-19 for South Asia"" to face any corona-like disaster. This platform is a collaboration where six South Asian countries like China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and the Maldives have joined and held a meeting on vaccine-related essential issues. The six countries agreed to work together to keep the required stock of medicine, including most notably, corona vaccine, to respond for post-corona poverty elimination, where required, and how to ease people's lives with an e-Commerce facility. This alliance has set a crackdown that the import of medical instruments by any member country of the ally will require prior approval of other members. The World Bank has already provided $500 million (50 crore) to Bangladesh to procure vaccine from the fund of $14 billion (1400 crore) that was formed focusing on corona handling issues of 9 South Asian countries. Moreover, Bangladesh was given a loan of $1.50 billion (150 crore) for recovering the post-corona-affected economy. In the present situation, the World Bank pledges to extend financial support of $2.0billion (200 crore) more to 17 countries, including Bangladesh, to ensure procurement and supply of corona vaccine for those countries.
The role of diplomacy is infinite in the selection of vaccines. There are some basic questions frequently raised in people's minds regarding which vaccine has more efficacy, which is safe for people or if there is adequate supply or availability of the vaccine, etc. So instead of depending heavily on good friendship with a country, Bangladesh should keep the interest of its 100 per cent people vaccinated, provided all the questions above are met. Bangladesh had an enormous scope and potential to become a vaccine-producing country. But in the beginning, we could not search out all other alternatives and scrutinise our capacity. Though it is a bit late, we finally could understand the insides behind the global vaccine business of others. This is the high time for Bangladesh not to be silly again, instead explore the best alternative to ensure vaccine for the people.
On the other hand, maintaining a good quality of vaccines is equally essential. So, Bangladesh must have a robust vaccine infrastructure and distribution network. After four months of the vaccination campaign, Bangladesh has administered more or less 9.5 million doses of the corona vaccine against its target of around 265 million doses. A survey from BRAC University has said vaccine cold-chain infrastructure in Bangladesh is yet to develop. The government needs to pay more attention to a higher vaccine stock. Undoubtedly, the efficacy of vaccines would be challenging to ensure at the peripheral or rural level if it is absent. The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) will have to think of it without wasting time anymore, and it is vital to respond to this emergency issue just now.
As the vaccine crisis continues, the second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine is not yet ensured for almost twenty-eight hundred thousand people who took 1st dose two months ago. The response from the UK to get the short supply of this vaccine is not as much as expected. China has already provided 500 thousand (5 lakh) doses of vaccine as a gift to us, and Bangladesh has resumed the vaccine programme again with the supply of China. Our government is lobbying vigorously to procure the best quality vaccine for the people. Our Hon'ble Prime Minister has already sanctioned Tk 100 billion (10 thousand crore) to procure vaccines. So, by and large, it brings some light of hope that all the country's people could be brought under the vaccination programme very shortly",https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/uploads/1625250804.jpg,"July 03, 2021",The Financial Express,,

“Economic diplomacy is also very important here. With a large population, Bangladesh is surely a big market for the vaccine producers which can be used as a bargaining tool during the negotiations,” he pointed out.

Delwar said two friendly countries — China and India — have already assured Bangladesh of giving priority in providing their vaccines due to their geopolitical interests. “We’ve already accepted China’s offer for the trial of its vaccine. We should also positively respond to India’s proposal. We should also look for options to join the trial of other vaccine candidates to create a scope to get it on a priority basis.”

He, however, expressed doubt about getting enough doses of any vaccine from sources like China and India as these countries have huge internal demand due to their very big population size. “So, we should keep it in mind the vaccine diplomacy. We need to focus on getting permission for manufacturing any vaccine in our country to ensure its availability here in due time.”

Maintaining contact with all potential vaccine-producing countries

Since it is uncertain which vaccine will finally come out as an effective one, Delwar said Bangladesh should maintain contact with all potential vaccine-producing countries and reach an understanding for getting their vaccines once those are approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).

“We must carefully monitor the development around the world regarding vaccines. We should have diversified sources. We’ll have to keep all the channels open. We’ll remain open to all. But before striking any written deal, we must remain very alert so that our money is not wasted and our national interest is not harmed in any way,” he advised.

As a developing country, Delwar said, Bangladesh should also make stronger efforts to have a vaccine with the help of Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (Gavi), Unicef, WHO, Pan American Health Organization (Paho), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), World Bank, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and others.

Prof Muzaherul Huq, former adviser to WHO South-East Asia region, said China, India, the UK, the US, and Russia are now the most potential vaccine-producing countries. “We should keep in touch with them all.”

Besides, he said, the government needs to have constant contact with Gavi or international bodies to have promised vaccine doses from them on the principle of equitable distribution.

Govt not depending on any particular source

Contacted, Health Minister Zahid Maleque said the government has been working actively and sincerely to get an effective vaccine whenever it is available. “We’re contacting multiple sources instead of depending on any particular one to have the sufficient doses of a vaccine at the right time.”

He said Bangladesh sent an application to Gavi in July through the WHO to avail COVAX Global Vaccines Facility for lower and middle-income countries. “Our application has been accepted.”

Besides, they have already allowed the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) to run phase three trial of China’s Sinovac’s Covid-19 vaccine in Bangladesh, he added. 

“The trial of Sinovac’s vaccine will begin within a few days. Initially, the trial will be conducted on volunteers, mainly doctors and nurses of six-seven hospitals.

“As we’re participating in the trial, we’ll get one lakh free doses of the vaccine primarily, and then we’ll get priority in procuring the vaccine. This vaccine can be available by next January,” the minister said.

He said Beximco Pharma signed a deal with India's Serum Institute to get priority access to the Covid-19 vaccines being developed by it.

Serum Institute has already partnered with Oxford/AstraZeneca along with Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi to produce more than a billion doses of the vaccine for global supply. “We hope Beximco Pharma will privately get a good number of vaccine doses from India,” Maleque said.

He said they also officially sought vaccine cooperation from India and they got assurance in this regard.

The minister said they sent a letter to Russia to get its vaccine and the country gave a positive response. “The Russian government wants to go under a government-to-government process fixing the rate of the vaccine. They may also allow us to produce their vaccines in Bangladesh.”

He said a letter was also sent to US drug-maker Pfizer for having its vaccine when it is available. “We hope they’ll give us the vaccine timely.”

About Oxford’s vaccine, Zahid said they will get it through India since the country has a partnership with AstraZeneca. “So, we won’t lag behind in providing vaccines to our people. We’re trying to get it from five to six sources. We’re even ready to procure necessary doses of vaccines, but we want an effective and harmless one at a fair price.”

He, however, said India has not yet come up with any offer to conduct trial of any vaccine in Bangladesh. “If we get any such proposal, we’ll decide it then.”

Earlier, Foreign Secretary Masud bin Momen said Dhaka intended to pick one potential vaccine that would be safe and most useful for Bangladesh while our efforts are on to get access to a potential Covid-19 vaccine”.

""It [vaccine] could be from China, Russia, the USA or India… our discussion is underway with them all,"" he added.

Delwar said two friendly countries — China and India — have already assured Bangladesh of giving priority in providing their vaccines due to their geopolitical interests. “We’ve already accepted China’s offer for the trial of its vaccine. We should also positively respond to India’s proposal. We should also look for options to join the trial of other vaccine candidates to create a scope to get it on a priority basis.”

He, however, expressed doubt about getting enough doses of any vaccine from sources like China and India as these countries have huge internal demand due to their very big population size. “So, we should keep it in mind the vaccine diplomacy. We need to focus on getting permission for manufacturing any vaccine in our country to ensure its availability here in due time.”'Coronavirus Covid-19' words in this illustration taken on April 10, 2020 Reuters

Govt not depending on any particular source for vaccine doses, says the health minister  


As many countries and companies are racing to develop vaccines to stop the Covid-19 pandemic, experts said Bangladesh needs to make “vaccine diplomacy” a part of its strategy to get one fast once it is ready.

In the context of polarized world politics, they said, Bangladesh should deal with both China and India smartly with an “open to all policy” alongside maintaining the contact with all the potential vaccine-producing countries to be among the first to procure an effective vaccine.

The experts, however, think it will still be too premature to make any final procurement deal with any potential vaccine-producing country right now since it is not clear which vaccine may prove safe and effective on completion of its phase three trial.

Contacted, Prof Delwar Hossain of Dhaka University’s International Relations department said Bangladesh seems to be lagging behind in coronavirus vaccine diplomacy for lack of proper planning, strategy, and initiative.

“We need smart diplomacy with proper planning and strategy to have enough doses of coronavirus vaccine from the successful candidate in due time,” he said.

The DU professor said it will be difficult to have a vaccine only relying on bilateral relations with a few countries as internal politics and political economy are involved with it.

“Economic diplomacy is also very important here. With a large population, Bangladesh is surely a big market for the vaccine producers which can be used as a bargaining tool during the negotiations,” he pointed out.

Delwar said two friendly countries — China and India — have already assured Bangladesh of giving priority in providing their vaccines due to their geopolitical interests. “We’ve already accepted China’s offer for the trial of its vaccine. We should also positively respond to India’s proposal. We should also look for options to join the trial of other vaccine candidates to create a scope to get it on a priority basis.”

He, however, expressed doubt about getting enough doses of any vaccine from sources like China and India as these countries have huge internal demand due to their very big population size. “So, we should keep it in mind the vaccine diplomacy. We need to focus on getting permission for manufacturing any vaccine in our country to ensure its availability here in due time.”

Maintaining contact with all potential vaccine-producing countries

Since it is uncertain which vaccine will finally come out as an effective one, Delwar said Bangladesh should maintain contact with all potential vaccine-producing countries and reach an understanding for getting their vaccines once those are approved by the World Health Organization (WHO).

“We must carefully monitor the development around the world regarding vaccines. We should have diversified sources. We’ll have to keep all the channels open. We’ll remain open to all. But before striking any written deal, we must remain very alert so that our money is not wasted and our national interest is not harmed in any way,” he advised.

As a developing country, Delwar said, Bangladesh should also make stronger efforts to have a vaccine with the help of Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (Gavi), Unicef, WHO, Pan American Health Organization (Paho), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), World Bank, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and others.

At one stage, Bangladesh found itself in a very challenging situation with respect to the procurement of vaccines to fight the ongoing pandemic due to the failure of the Serum Institute of India to supply the vaccines under a deal and the unavailability of the shots throughout the world owing to high infection rates.Despite some anxious times, China came to the aid of the country by providing much-needed vaccines. China also agreed to co-produce vaccines in Bangladesh.  

Later, Bangladesh received a substantial amount of jabs from quite a few countries, especially from the US and Japan.     ",https://new-media.dhakatribune.com/en/uploads/2021/12/30/2-8.jpeg,"December 30, 2021",Dhaka Tribune,"2021 in review: A year marked by vaccine diplomacy, US sanctions on RAB",
2022/0011,Article,https://www.daily-sun.com/arcprint/details/531724/Vaccine-Diplomacy-Heralds-New-Era-of-IndoBangladesh-Amity/2021-01-25,"When a plane of ‘Air India’ landed at Hazrat Shah Jalal International Airport in Dhaka, it was not just landing of an aeroplane, but it heralded a new era of vaccine diplomacy. The plane carried 20 lakh doses of corona vaccine that India had earlier committed for supplying to Bangladesh. India has fulfilled its promise. In the coming days too, India has expressed its intention to send more vaccine to Bangladesh. Following arrival of vaccine in Bangladesh, Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar stated that his country gives the highest importance to Indo-Bangladesh relations. This has been evident by the supply of vaccine. At this moment, a new era of Indo-Bangladesh ties has begun.

The foundation of the relationship is vaccine friendship. This friendship is a top priority to India. The reason is that India follows the ‘Neighbour First’ policy. In our foreign policy, there was a culture of giving least priority to neighbours.  In our foreign policy, there was a dependence on Europe and the United States (US). Now, we have given the first priority to our neighbours. Again, Bangladesh bears a great significance in this regard. In the past, I have written about it. I am stating this time and again. This is about the geo-strategic location of Bangladesh that has an importance. There is an element of amity in diplomacy. It is not only the political culture of India but also that of the entire world. Emotion is involved there. In political field too, emotion works which is termed as political emotion. Centring the political emotion, scores of researchers are engaged in its analysis. Alongside the emotion, there has been a reasonable pragmatic direction.

It is worth-remembering that India has played an important role in producing the vaccine. It will not be proper to look at it from the point of petty politics or party politics. It would be improper to look at it through the prism of BJP-Congress political polarisation. By giving importance to the prime minister’s intention of vaccine production, due importance is given to the Indian scientists. Now, India is producing 60 per cent of the global output of vaccine. It is not a trifling matter.
India is sending the vaccine not only to its neighbours but also to some other states as per their requirement. As Pakistan and Iran did not want the vaccine, India refrained from sending the same to the two states. It is being presumed that both Pakistan and Iran are eager to get vaccine from China. But, in vaccine diplomacy, there is a background of emotion with Bangladesh. No doubt, it is true, but by sending vaccine to other countries, India is tackling the vaccine diplomacy of China. The China-Pakistan axis creates a complex and tough situation from security point of view. It is still not clear that after the exit of Donald Trump what will be the foreign policy of the US towards India and China. Certainly, it will maintain a balanced policy. Like Trump, it is presumed that personally Biden will certainly not be that much anti-Pakistani. It is even presumed that financial assistance as well as vaccine assistance to Pakistan might be restored under Biden’s leadership. With China, Biden might not resort to the path of conflict, but he might follow the path of dialogue. It is also predicted that Biden would follow the path of Obama that he started by visiting China.

In such a changing global political scenario, it is beyond doubt that India needs Bangladesh much. First of all, one lakh dose of Indian vaccine was sent to the Maldives. It was followed by Bhutan where one and a half lakh dose of Indian vaccine was sent. Next it was sent to Bangladesh and Nepal. But the volume that was sent to Bangladesh was much more than that of other neighbours. The Serum Institute of India is producing the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. And that is being sent to various countries.

The future of the Indo-Bangladesh vaccine amity is now much brighter. The reason is the relationship of blood with Bangladesh besides the political and diplomatic relationship. Since the Liberation War of Bangladesh, India maintains the cordial relationship. Both the countries have jointly faced the foe. At the personal level, a unique bond of leadership has been created. All these have created a background of a different type of amity, especially in this Mujib Year. That memory! That love! That emotion! The Indo-Bangladesh bilateral friendly relations will further strengthen. During the period of Mujib Year, the Bangladesh High Commissioner to India, Muhammad Imran, on January 22, went to Delhi’s Bigyan Bhaban to witness an exhibition of Indo-Bangladesh amity. This exhibition was inaugurated virtually on December 17 during a video conference held between Bangladesh Premier Sheikh Hasina and Indian PM Narendra Modi. Observing the exhibition, Muhammad Imran termed it as an extra-ordinary one. The exhibition consists of many rare pictures, not only of war, but also of leaders. There is lots of information besides the pictures. The governments of the two countries are overseeing those. Muhammad Imran went round the exhibits and issued a statement. This exhibition will be on show in Kolkata too. After its show in Dhaka, the exhibition will finally be displayed at the United Nations. I am mentioning about the exhibition because of the Indo-Bangladesh bilateral ties and Mujib Year celebration programmes. Alongside, there is vaccine diplomacy. This diplomacy has heralded a new era of vaccine amity.

2022/0012,Article,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/india-tries-vaccine-diplomacy-with-bangladesh-close-on-heels-of-china,"When Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla was in Dhaka earlier this month to try and mend a frayed relationship with Bangladesh, one of the offers he made was that of a potential Covid-19 vaccine.

Bangladesh, he said, will get priority access to a vaccine produced by India.

""When the vaccine is produced, it goes without saying that our closest neighbours, friends, partners and other countries will be part of it,"" he told reporters in Dhaka.
India's ""vaccine diplomacy"" comes at a time when its strategic rival China has made a similar offer to Bangladesh.

According to China's nationalist tabloid Global Times, Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Li Jiming has even offered to be the ""first vo-lunteer"" for a phase three trial of the Chinese Sinovac vaccine in Bangladesh.

Dhaka, after deliberating for more than a month, allowed Sinovac's trials to proceed in the country last Thursday.
China has offered similar priority access to its vaccine to Pakistan and many other countries in Africa and South-east Asia in an effort to further reinforce its clout.An Indian government source told The Straits Times that finer details of a vaccine-sharing programme will be worked out when India is certain of having a successful product to offer. ""When we do, India will follow its 'Neighbourhood First' policy,"" he said.

But before it supplies a Covid-19 vaccine to other countries, India, which has one of the world's biggest caseloads of coronavirus infections, will need to vaccinate its 1.3 billion population.

China, on the other hand, could have a better head start in exporting a vaccine, given that it has largely contained the pandemic within its territory.Indian companies, however, retain the advantage of having a longer established track record as a globally trusted manufacturing partner and supplier of vaccines as well as medicines, said Dr Rory Horner, a senior lecturer at The University of Manchester's Global Development Institute.

""This may give them an advantage in terms of having trusted relationships, quality approvals and partnerships with other firms, governments, international organisations and donors for the global supply of Covid-19 vaccines, if found to be effective,"" Dr Horner told ST in an e-mail.

In comparison, Chinese firms do not have a similarly well-established position to supply vaccines around the world, he added.

The Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines by volume, has secured a manufacturing contract for two leading Covid-19 vaccine candidates - those from AstraZeneca and Novavax.

It has also partnered Gavi, a global alliance for vaccines, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to speed up manufacturing and delivery of up to 100 million doses of potential Covid-19 vaccines for India and other low-and middle-income countries next year.

SII recently began phase two trials for AstraZeneca's Covishield vaccine in India.

Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila, two Indian firms that have developed indigenous vaccines, have finished phase one trials.

Russia is also exploring the possibility of manufacturing its Sputnik V vaccine in India, whose producers remain critical to any global vaccine roll-out plan, given their vast manufacturing capacity as well as competitive edge.

While the Indian government is yet to finalise how it intends to share a vaccine with others, Dr Bhaskar Balakrishnan, a Science Diplomacy Fellow at Delhi-based Research and Information System for Developing Countries, told ST that it could do so through the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme set up in 1964.

""Judging from similar things in the past, the government is more likely to provide vaccines and drugs under its aid programme on a grant basis,"" said Dr Balakrishnan.

He added that this approach could be different from that of China, which has reportedly offered its vaccine through loans requiring repayment.

Recipient countries, meanwhile, are hedging their bets to ensure they are among the first to get access to any successful vaccine.

Bangladesh Enterprise Institute senior research director Faiz Sobhan told ST: ""Ultimately, whichever vaccine Bangladesh goes for will likely depend on the following factors - which manufacturer is among the first to produce the vaccine, if they can make sufficiently large quantities... available to Bangladesh, and the cost of the vaccine.""

On December 13, approximately 790 thousand doses of those will be airlifted from Japan to Bangladesh as the first batch.

Thus, a total of approximately 4.55 million doses will have been provided to Bangladesh, including approximately 1.49 million doses provided this time.

These vaccines are expected to contribute to the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. Japan will continue to provide various assistance in cooperation with relevant countries and international organizations towards the earliest convergence of COVID-19.

2022/0014,,https://www.stimson.org/2021/indias-flawed-vaccine-diplomacy/,"On January 21, 2021 India began its Vaccine Maitri campaign—a diplomatic initiative inspired by the ancient Indian philosophical doctrine of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ (the world is one family). Under the rubric of India’s Neighbourhood First Policy, the campaign provided the Oxford-AstraZeneca/Serum Institute of India (SII) manufactured Covishield vaccine to India’s immediate neighborhood and Bhutan and the Maldives.

The Vaccine Maitri initiative began strongly as India provided a substantial number of Covishield doses to neighboring countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka (excluding Pakistan and China). This increased India’s soft power within South Asia by reaffirming its role as the “Pharmacy of the World.” The temporary suspension of the Vaccine Maitri initiative at the onset of India’s second wave of the pandemic has both left India’s neighbors stranded and given China the opportunity to increase its influence in South Asia in the short term. India must first work to build credibility domestically before it can fulfill its commitments to the region and counter burgeoning Chinese influence in its neighborhood.

By April 2021, much of South Asia experienced deadly waves of the pandemic, stemming from a combination of factors: geographical proximity to India, weak health infrastructures, and a delay in the delivery of Covishield vaccines.

Tide Turns Against India 
By the end of April 2021, when India recorded 18,767,962 cases, with deaths under-reported all across the country, the Indian government suspended the Vaccine Maitri initiative to address the health emergency at home. India had by then exported 64.5 million doses of the Covishield vaccines to 85 plus countries. India’s neighbors also placed commercial orders with SII to purchase Covishield vaccines; however, these orders were postponed to meet the growing vaccine demand within India.

By April 2021, much of South Asia experienced deadly waves of the pandemic, stemming from a combination of factors: geographical proximity to India, weak health infrastructures, and a delay in the delivery of Covishield vaccines. Nepal, with a long, porous border with India, saw an exponential rise in cases in April 2021 and reported over 8,000 cases in a single day, with, at one point, a 45 percent positivity rate. Bangladesh saw a staggering rise in cases, with 38 out of 64 national districts labeled “high-risk zones” in April 2021. The COVID-19 situation in Bangladesh remains worrying as high infection and death rates are reported throughout the country. Sri Lanka faces a similar predicament as it encountered a virulent wave of the pandemic with an average increase of 800+ cases per day. Sri Lanka too is grappling with high infection rates despite lockdowns in place across the country.

India’s inability to provide vaccines to its neighbors—at a time when these countries reported spikes in cases—has demonstrated India’s limits in leading South Asia and pushed South Asian governments to look for alternative vaccines suppliers to meet domestic demands. China has stepped in as India’s image as a preeminent power in South Asia has taken a hit. Nepal and Bangladesh have criticized New Delhi for the suspension of its vaccine diplomacy initiative at a time of critical need. For example, a leading Bangladeshi businessman asked India to prove its friendship towards Bangladesh by providing the COVID-19 vaccines that Bangladesh had paid for in advance. Political leadership in Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka have faced challenges from opposition parties over their over-dependence on India for vaccines.

This change in perception does not augur well for India since the neighborhood has traditionally been central to its strategic interests. Although some have suggested that India’s inability to provide vaccines will not affect its ties with its South Asian neighbors in the long run, in all likelihood, India will have limited diplomatic bandwidth to pursue major foreign policy goals within South Asia in the near future. For example, India is unlikely to initiate ambitious naval modernization plans to enhance power projection within the region while China has taken the lead in that respect. Similarly, India may have to negotiate with China from a position of weakness amidst the ongoing border talks after the flareup in Galwan. Poor pandemic management has reduced India’s ability to maneuver on key foreign policy issues.

China in South Asia
The suspension of the Vaccine Maitri initiative has hindered vaccination programs across much of South Asia and provided China with an opportunity to enhance its footprint in the region. China has deepened its engagement with India’s neighbor, Pakistan, by providing it with 1.2 million doses of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine, making Pakistan the first major recipient of overseas Chinese vaccine aid. Subsequently, China’s timely provision of vaccines to India’s neighbors has demonstrated China’s ability to respond quickly to crises.

China has also supplied vaccines to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal, first as grants and then commercially; onlookers cannot ignore the strategic subtext of this development. China wants India to acclimatize itself to the idea that China is a leading power within South Asia and the world. As part of this, China wants to befriend India’s traditional allies in South Asia on the basis of the “Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence” in order to eventually persuade/coerce India to accept the idea that New Delhi and Beijing can harmoniously coexist in South Asia. This clichéd notion of “harmonious co-existence” is directly linked to the Chinese principle of Tianxia (All Under Heaven) that has influenced Chinese foreign policy towards South Asia. In order to bolster its influence in South Asia, China has both increased its economic engagement with India’s neighbors in recent years and oriented its vaccine diplomacy towards providing a counterweight to Indian influence in South Asia.

India’s recent absence from a virtual meeting China hosted to discuss South Asia’s pandemic response exhibits how India opposes a growing Chinese presence in South Asia. India has countered the pandemic in South Asia by conducting virtual summits under the umbrella of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in March 2020. China’s plans to create a “Health Silk Route” passing through South Asia are inimical to Indian interests since South Asia has traditionally been India’s backyard. India sees China’s “Health Silk Route” project as an extension of the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI), which has led some to fear that China seeks the encirclement of India. New Delhi also fears China can use the “Health Silk Route” to increase its clout in South Asia through soft power.

As India’s neighbors have addressed their vaccine supply demands by finding alternative sources, India should vaccinate its domestic population and ultimately aim to provide the remaining vaccines to its neighbors and the COVAX facility.

India’s Options
As India’s neighbors have addressed their vaccine supply demands by finding alternative sources, India should vaccinate its domestic population and ultimately aim to provide the remaining vaccines to its neighbors and the COVAX facility. This would help it restore its image as a responsible health provider within South Asia. Since Indian vaccines like Covishield and Covaxin are more effective against COVID-19 than the Chinese Sinopharm and SinoVac vaccines, India should revamp its vaccine supplies. Demand for the Indian vaccine remains high within much of South Asia.

India can start to revamp its vaccination program by requesting that its Quad allies provide it funds with which to meet its domestic shortage and vaccinate its population faster. Since the United States is likely to distribute seven million vaccines to Asian countries including India, New Delhi can use these vaccines to inoculate its own citizens. South Asian states such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka can adopt a nuanced approach and manage their diplomatic relations with India and China by remaining neutral, following independent foreign policies that emphasize development.

As India diversifies its vaccination options and uses other vaccines like the indigenous Covaxin and the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, it will be able to vaccinate its local population and export the surplus vaccines within its neighborhood. The resumption of the Vaccine Maitri Initiative will not only enable India to fulfill its existing vaccination commitments within South Asia but also allow it to counter China in the region and play a role in ending the global pandemic.

The Indian gift to Dhaka was a fulfilment of the assurance given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during the December 17, 2020, virtual summit. Both the countries have been cooperating in the field of Covid-19 vaccine, including Phase III testing, distribution, co-production and delivery in Bangladesh.The leadership of Sri Lanka and Nepal also expressed their apprehension about the Chinese vaccine to their Indian interlocutors. The demand of Indian vaccine has come from small countries far and away like Barbados, whose Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley wrote to PM Modi on January 22 for the supply of 200,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine with the proviso of purchasing half of the doses. The request has been approved.According to diplomats based in Dhaka and Delhi, around October 2020, the Chinese wanted to sign a contract with the Sheikh Hasina government to supply CoronaVac vaccines. One of the terms of the contract was that Dhaka had to share the cost of the clinical trials. While Dhaka refused to share the cost of the trials, the Chinese company said that Bangladesh could not be an exception to not sharing costs as Sinovac was putting the same conditions for countries in which clinical trials were conducted and as a precursor to jab supplies.It was only then that Dhaka moved swiftly and tied up with SII with the Modi government doing the facilitation for commercial supply of 30 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Three million doses of commercial supplies have already landed in Dhaka.India has already rolled out five million doses of the coronavirus vaccine to seven countries in the neighbourhood, the first being Bhutan on January 20 and the latest being Mauritius on January 22.

Bangladesh’s fight against the coronavirus pandemic, and the country’s economic recovery, will be reinforced by this donation from the UK.The vaccine consignment arrived in Bangladesh on 13 December. While welcoming the donation, the British High Commissioner HE Robert Chatterton Dickson said:

We welcome the arrival of over 4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the UK to Bangladesh. Like the rest of the world the UK and Bangladesh have experienced difficult times because of the pandemic. And we are both in it together in building back better, safer, greener.

This vaccine donation by the UK is a powerful demonstration of Brit Bangla Bondhon between two countries. The UK will do everything we can to support Bangladesh to save lives and defeat the pandemic.

On the afternoon of 15 December, Mr. Zahid Maleque, MP, Honourable Minister, Bangladesh Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, received the donations officially in an event held at the Bangladesh government’s guest house Padma. Japanese Ambassador to Bangladesh HE Ito Naoki, UNICEF Representative to Bangladesh, Mr. Sheldon Yett, and senior officials from the government of Bangladesh were present at the event.

At the G7 this year, the UK committed to donate 100 million doses by June 2022. 80% of those UK doses will be distributed through the COVAX facility.

The UK has been at the forefront of the global response to COVID-19, including through investing £90 million to support the development of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Over half a billion doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have been delivered at a non-profit price globally, with two-thirds going to lower and middle-income countries.

The UK also kick-started efforts to establish COVAX in 2020, providing a total of £548 million to fund vaccines for lower income countries. The scheme has delivered more than 152 million vaccine doses to over 137 countries and territories, including in 83 lower-middle income countries. 65% of the initial vaccine doses have been Oxford-AstraZeneca. COVAX aims to deliver 1.8 billion vaccines to lower-income countries around the world by early 2022.

the UK provided £90 million to support the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine: £25m on the initial research & development, and £65m to scale up manufacturing

the UK made it clear as part of that funding that the vaccine should be affordable around the world and consequently AstraZeneca agreed to distribute it at a non-profit price during the pandemic

the cost of this donation has been funded through UK Overseas Development Assistance and will come over and above the ODA spending target of 0.5% of GNI if needed

the UK has been supporting the Bangladesh Ministry of Health to develop a well-coordinated national response plan to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, resourced by development partners and the Government of Bangladesh

Vaccination efforts will also include Rohingya refugees from Myanmar currently hosted in Bangladesh.

 

The financing will help Bangladesh to mitigate the health effects of the coronavirus pandemic and enable the country to strengthen its healthcare system and protect its people from COVID-19 with effective vaccines. These are all key preconditions for continued sustainable economic and social growth.

 

This is the first operation allocated under the €425 million South Asia Public Healthcare COVID-19 programme approved by the EIB in 2021. This programme aims to provide long-term support for COVID-19 vaccination, pandemic preparedness and health system resilience in Bangladesh, the Maldives and potentially other countries in South Asia.

 

EIB Vice-President Christian Kettel Thomsen, who is responsible for operations in South Asia, said: “The EIB is very proud to expand Team Europe support for Bangladesh, ensuring its people are protected from coronavirus with effective vaccines. Together with the €1.3 billion in EIB support already extended to the COVAX vaccine-procurement initiative, operations like these are a key step in accelerating global immunisation and a quick and effective victory over the virus. At the same time, this operation underlines our strong, long-term commitment to working with other members of Team Europe and the Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh to ensure a safe, green and sustainable future for Bangladesh and its people.”

 

Ambassador of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh to the European Union, H.E. Mahbub Hassan Saleh, said: “The EIB’s loan of €250 million to the Government of Bangladesh for procuring COVID-19 vaccines is the biggest and most significant development in the 22-year long journey of the Bangladesh-EIB partnership. The footprint of the EIB in Bangladesh is becoming larger and expanding into new areas, which would continue in the days ahead and contribute to greater socioeconomic development in the country. Climate change, infrastructure and renewable energy are some key areas of importance to Bangladesh and the European Union, where the EIB’s involvement can be robust in the coming days.”

 

EU Ambassador to the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, H.E. Charles Whiteley, said: “The substantial support from the EIB that is being confirmed today marks a very welcome addition to the Team Europe partnership with Bangladesh to fight the pandemic. EU relations with Bangladesh are expanding in so many fields: from climate change to business, from connectivity to people-to-people relations. This commitment in the health sector is a further signal of the strengthening of our ties.”

 

The operation is covered by the EU EFSD+ Comprehensive Guarantee and its Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI).

 

Team Europe and the EIB accelerate COVID-19 vaccine deployment across the world

Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the EIB has been providing long-term financing to support national healthcare systems, including to accelerate local vaccine deployment in countries throughout the world. The EU bank has been supporting vaccine research and production as well as COVID-19 diagnosis and treatments.

 

With EIB innovative cost-sharing financial instruments and contributions from the European Commission and EU countries, Team Europe has committed more than €3 billion to COVAX, the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history of the world. Today, Europe is exporting more vaccines than any other region in the world, with the EIB actively supporting build-up of vaccine production capacities in less developed regions across the globe.

 

In January 2022, COVAX delivered the 1 billionth COVID-19 vaccine dose, following distribution of the life-saving vaccines to some 144 countries.

 

As part of its global COVID-19 response in 2021, the EIB Group increased its financing for the health and life sciences sector to almost €5.5 billion, with €1 billion invested into health and life sciences funds. Overall, more than 780 million people around the world will benefit from improved health services, including COVID-19 vaccines, made possible by EIB financing.

 

EIB Global: a new partner for Team Europe

Last year, the EIB Group provided €8.1 billion of financing to projects in more than 160 countries outside the European Union including Bangladesh, bringing the total amount of investments outside the EU to more than €1.5 trillion.

 

In January 2022 the EIB announced establishment of EIB Global, its branch dedicated to international partnerships and development finance. EIB Global will bring together all of the EIB’s resources and expertise gained outside the European Union under a clear management structure that can make a stronger, more focused contribution to Team Europe projects and initiatives.

In a video message to the inaugural ceremony of the Global Centre for Traditional Medicine (GCTM) at Jamnagar in Gujarat, she said that ""the whole world has seen how the two neighbours support each other and work together during the time of crisis"". ""The Bangladesh-India cooperation during the COVID-19 pandemic was a role model in good neighbourhood diplomacy,"" she was quoted as saying by The Daily Star newspaper.

Hasina said that the efforts of the government of India, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and achieving massive vaccination coverage, are really commendable.

She mentioned that Bangladesh has also successfully controlled the pandemic and the first dose of the vaccine covered 100 per cent of the targeted population while the second dose covered 97 per cent. ""I believe, if the traditional medicine is practiced in tandem with the modern medicine, we may expect the better outcome in ensuring basic healthcare for all..,"" Prime Minister Hasina said.

Hasina said that the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic has shown the need to revisit the focus on ensuring good health and well-being of the people. ""It is important that the ancient knowledge-base of traditional medicine be combined with modern science and technologies to optimise its benefits,"" she said.

In Bangladesh, Hasina said, traditional medicine has always been a part of its history and cultural tradition. ""We have officially recognised the potential contribution of Unani, Ayurvedic, and Homeopathic medical services to our efforts in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3. We shall positively consider joint medical research projects in areas of our mutual interest,"" the prime minister said.

About 16 Lakh people in Bangladesh are waiting for their second dose of vaccine from India as they had already taken the first dose sent from India. India said earlier it is not possible to send vaccines at this time.

According to Dhaka sources, anger over the issue is raging in that country. This is directly reflected in the context of Bengali’s favourite fish hilsa. Bangladesh had banned hilsa exports to India for some time now. Despite this, the Hasina government had given clearance for the export of 2,000 tonnes of hilsa to West Bengal during the Jamaisashti last year. But this year the case is different.Some say it would not be wise to make such a simplification that the export of hilsa was stopped because the promised vaccine was not sent. But it is also true that the relationship between the two sides has become not so smooth with the hilsa-diplomacy is no longer there.Hilsa is also a diplomatic symbol in the ups and downs of India-Bangladesh relations. Earlier, when Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee went to Dhaka to sign the land boundary agreement, she asked Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after seeing the huge amount of hilsa items in the menu list, why are they keeping so much hilsa? Hasina’s quick reply was, “As soon as the water of Teesta come, the fish will be able to swim away and go away!"" Fishermen’s association saying that there is no reason to get frustrated now. From July 2012 to 2018, Bangladesh didn’t send hilsa. From 2019, it has started again with occasional purpose. In 2019 and 2020, fish has been supplied to the West Bengal market from Bangladesh in September.

Whatever the politics of vaccines, hilsa is growing well in Bangladesh this year and fishermen in India are optimistic about getting hilsa.

Atul Chandra Das, Secretory Fish Importer Association said, “In the last two years, 500 to 1,950 metric tonne of hilsa has been exported from Bangladesh to India. This year, the amount will increase. The price of Bangladesh hilsa is around Rs 800 to Rs 1,200. Additionally, fishes will come from Myanmar, Maharashtra and Gujarat. But obviously, the taste will be not good as Bangladesh.""

According to Bangladesh sources, Prime Minister Narendra Modi also spoke to the country’s top leadership during his visit to Dhaka in March on the issue of vaccination. But after the second wave of Covid-19 hit India, the South Block decided to suspend vaccine exports to neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka. On Sunday, June 20, India’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh, Vikram Doraiswami, said that the country is keen to resume the export of Covid-19 vaccines to Dhaka as soon as possible, but there is no word yet when it will resume the export.

Bangladesh had signed a deal in November with the Serum Institute of India, the world’s biggest vaccine maker, for 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The country of more than 160 million people has already received 9 million vaccine doses from the SII. India has also previously gifted 2 million doses of the shot to Bangladesh. According to Bangladesh, after receiving so much assurance from India about the vaccine, interested China was sent back. Now, China has reached the point of bargaining with them.

2022/0020,News,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bangladesh-reaches-out-to-india-us-for-covid-vaccine-doses-7320740/,"Faced with a shortage of vaccines, Bangladesh has reached out to India and the US for supplying surplus AstraZeneca vaccines to Dhaka.

Sources said Bangladesh Foreign Minister A K Abdul Momen called up External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday and asked for AstraZeneca vaccines, as the country faces a shortage and is unable to give the second dose to its citizens.

Sources said Dhaka has also reached out to Washington for the vaccines through diplomatic channels as well the Bangladesh-American community in the US.This came a day after US President Joe Biden on Monday announced that the US will begin shipping 20 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccines to unspecified countries by June-end, in addition to 60 million shots of AstraZeneca vaccines that have already been pledged for distribution subject to authorisation by the drug regulator.Bangladesh, which has imposed a national lockdown, has seen more than 7.8 lakh Covid-19 cases, and more than 12,000 deaths so far. The country’s efforts to vaccinate its people has been hit by India’s inability to supply it more vaccines due to the second surge and opening up of vaccination for all adults in India.The Serum Institute of India (SII) was supposed to send 50 lakh doses a month to Bangladesh over a six-month period starting January. The SII delivered the first 50 lakh doses as per the deal, but shipped only 20 lakh in February. No other shipment has been made since.

India sent 33 lakh doses as a grant as part of its vaccine diplomacy. So Bangladesh has in total received 1.03 crore doses of AstraZeneca vaccines so far.The country is also supposed to get 6.8 crore vaccine doses this year from Covax, a global alliance. The alliance had earlier said that Bangladesh would get 1.27 crore doses between May and June, but there has been no supply so far.

During his phone conversation with Jaishankar, sources said, Momen asked him to request the US administration to send some vaccines to Bangladesh.

While Dhaka has made the first such request to India, it is not alone. Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives are also unable to get vaccines after India stopped sending supplies in order to meet local needs.The UNICEF has stated that the situation in India is creating a crisis in neighbouring countries. “Cases are exploding and health systems are struggling in countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives…and also in Argentina and Brazil,” UNICEF director Henrietta Fore said in New York.

The Bangladesh government started mass inoculation on February 7 with a target of vaccinating 160 million people in phases. Only 2 per cent of the country’s population has so far got both shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine and less than 4 per cent got the first shot as of Sunday, according to Bangladesh health authorities.

2022/0021,Article,https://www.thecambridgeglobalaffair.co.uk/collaborators/what-happened-to-indias-vaccine-diplomacy,"Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, India was one of the world’s largest vaccine producers, manufacturing approximately 60% of the world’s vaccines. Accordingly, India initially became one of the global leaders in COVID-19 vaccine dissemination , delivering tens of millions of doses to countries in Asia, Africa, and the Americas during the first few months of 2021. This large-scale state-sponsored vaccine proliferation has often been referred to as vaccine diplomacy, where global powers like India, China, and the US use vaccine deliveries to not only contribute to a swifter end to the pandemic, but to also strengthen bilateral and multilateral relations with recipient countries. However, Indian vaccine diplomacy quickly faded when a massive second wave of COVID cases and deaths swept India in spring 2021. To firmly restore the importance of its vaccine diplomacy, the Indian government needs to make sure it is as protected from future domestic waves as possible. India should also take steps to better compete with its main regional rival China in vaccine delivery.
What went wrong in India? 

 In 2020 and early 2021, many, including India’s leaders, believed that perhaps COVID did not hit India as hard as expected or that India’s public health system was effectively able to contain the pandemic when cases first appeared. This contributed to a significant lapse in safety measures like widespread masking and social measuring, as well as very high participation in public religious festivals and other crowded events. Then, from March-May 2021, cases skyrocketed across the country, shattering daily records- on May 1st, 2021, there were over 400,000 cases reported in India (the US reported less than 50,000 that same day). Unsurprisingly, deaths also spiked and there was a debilitating shortage of critical medical supplies and devices, like oxygen tanks. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his administration were widely criticized for declaring a premature victory against COVID-19 prior to this second wave and for exporting vaccines they could have used domestically. In response to this second wave and such criticism, India imposed drastic export restrictions on vaccines, all but eliminating vaccine outflows to other countries and putting vaccine diplomacy on hold throughout much of 2021. 

In stark contrast, China appears to have done much better than India in containing COVID in 2021. On December 26, 2021, the outbreak in the city of Xi’an provided the highest daily case count since 2020, but this was only 158 cases. Although there is international skepticism regarding whether China is accurately providing its COVID data, the country’s policy of swiftly and strictly locking down cities with significant numbers of cases seems to be paying off.  Accordingly, China is stepping in where Indian vaccine diplomacy was halted, sending vaccines to Nepal, Bangladesh, and other countries who once depended on India for their vaccine supplies. China is using these developments to strategically align India’s neighbors with the former in order to geopolitically aid China’s expansionary foreign policy objective of being seen as the leading power/influencer in South Asia.

What can India do to regain lost ground? In October 2021, after hundreds of millions of Indians became fully vaccinated (a number that is continuing to sharply increase to this day) Prime Minister Modi declared that India is finally relaxing its export restrictions and is “ready to save humanity” once again through vaccine deliveries. However, the key to sustainably redeeming India’s vaccine diplomacy policies is carefully and effectively balancing domestic public health with international distribution. As early as June 2021, as lockdowns began to ease post-second wave, tightly packed crowds came back and social distancing and mask wearing declined. Especially since India now fears a third wave driven by the recent surge of the Omicron variant worldwide, the Indian government needs to be more vigilant in enforcing public health measures and controlling crowd sizes nationwide. Additionally, while the news about increasing vaccination is good, India has its own growing anti-vaxx movement, which it needs to countered with productive, anti-myth information campaigns and better control of what is posted online. If the proper measures are taken to address these problems, India’s new vaccine diplomacy focus is sure to be longer-lived than the last. 

India also has advantages in its efforts to compete with China over vaccine diplomacy. In July 2021, Indonesia and Thailand announced that they were moving away from Chinese Sinovac vaccines because of concerns of their quality and efficacy. They decided on other vaccines like those created by AstraZeneca (of which India is one of the largest producers). Additionally, other countries like Sri Lanka have seen controversies concerning the high financial cost of the Chinese vaccines. If its past vaccine diplomacy efforts are any indication, India can very likely get vaccines to these countries that are both cheaper and more effective than those provided by China. Additionally, India has the support of some of the most powerful countries in Asia and the world who also want to see China’s growing influence mitigated. In September 2021, the international group known as the Quad (comprised of the US, Japan, Australia, and India) reiterated support for the Quad Vaccine Partnership, which aims to pool each country’s resources to provide around 1 billion vaccines to be distributed globally by the end of 2022. This a strong alternative for countries either considering or already receiving vaccines from China. 

Until April 2021, India was one of the world’s leaders in vaccine diplomacy- delivering over 65 million doses worldwide. During that time, Indian made strides in improving its relations with recipient neighbors like Nepal and Bangladesh. These strides were replaced with disappointment when Nepal and Bangladesh were forced to turn elsewhere for vaccines as India suffered from its second COVID wave. However, many South Asian countries prefer a balance of power between India and China in the region and are therefore eager to see India shipping vaccines at full capacity again. The opportunity is there for India, but whether India will permanently become a reliable vaccine exporter or shrink away again in the face of another wave remains to be seen.

2022/0022,Article,https://ypfbd.org/a-new-normal-a-new-priority-vaccine-diplomacy-and-bangladesh/,"Vaccines have been the long sought silver bullet in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Today, laboratories are household names – everyone can recognize the world’s vaccine producers, from Pfizer to Sinopharm. Consequently, they have also become policy priorities across the world. Countries are scrambling to secure enough vaccines to inoculate their population – in the process, the deep disparity between developing and developed countries in procuring vaccines have been revealed, and the ensuing competition has prompted states to use their tools as best as possible to retrieve vaccines. 

Diplomacy has stood out as a most formidable tool. It has augmented the procurement strategies of states, complemented geopolitical strategy and has become a striking new priority in a striking new normal. In foreign policy discourse, “vaccine diplomacy” has joined the ranks of other diplomatic avenues like “climate diplomacy”. Bangladesh has seemingly recognized the potency of diplomacy as a tool for vaccine procurement – the role of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in soliciting vaccine donations has been most laudable – and it reveals many implications that vaccine diplomacy brings forward for the world to consider. 

Bangladesh had slumped into a vaccine crisis early this year. Originally, it had opted to rely on India’s Covishield vaccine, having struck a deal with its Serum Institute to receive five million vaccines a month (Dhaka Tribune, 2021). India’s brutal second wave had brought the country to its knees, and in turn, severely restricted export of vaccines. The shortage brought about a temporary end to Bangladesh’s vaccination campaign – only recently would the government restart COVID-19 vaccination.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs must be applauded in this regard – it has played a proactive role in soliciting vaccine donations from countries all across the world and across the board. It has leveraged a strong partnership with China to receive approximately 15 million Sinopharm vaccines over the next few months, affiliations with Covax and allies such as the US and Japan to receive millions of Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines, as well as further agreements with Russia to co-produce and purchase Sputnik vaccines. Next year, Bangladesh is expected to receive a gargantuan consignment of Johnson & Johnson vaccines that are intended to inoculate a vast proportion of the population. In short, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has enjoyed much success in leveraging existing, strong partnerships to receive vaccines.

It is important to note the lessons that can be learnt from Bangladesh’s vaccine diplomacy. There are three key learnings that should be stressed upon in both current and future endeavours relating to vaccine procurement:

Making use of the Bangladeshi diaspora – the Bangladeshi diaspora have played a key role in channeling vaccine donations from the US (Mortoza, 2021), and their support should be well recognized as a diplomatic asset. There are countless members of the Bangladeshi diaspora across the world, and their willingness to aid the country should be used as a strong diplomatic tool.
Maintaining diversity of sources – The earlier vaccine crisis demonstrated the folly of relying on a single source for Bangladesh. Should the source be compromised, it would paralyze Bangladesh’s own vaccine initiatives. Thus, a diverse basket of sources should be leveraged. This is feasible thanks to Bangladesh’s policy of “Friendship with all, malice with none”.
Ensuring proactiveness – Bangladesh’s diplomatic maneuvers in regards to vaccination have been very persistent. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has engaged with actors from different international circles repeatedly. This has been a fruitful exercise and has ensured the delivery of millions of vaccines in June and July.
Although Bangladesh’s vaccine successes are certainly laudable, they do expose a growing international reality wherein vaccines do not just serve as a diplomatic priority – instead, they come to define the way state actors interact with one another. The most apparent reality is the soft power of vaccines – the goodwill brought forward through the donation of vaccines serves as a source of power for states to leverage over others. China, for example, faced significant loss of face with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, given that the virus had originated from the country. However, its production and donation of vaccines across the world have helped mend its image, allowing it to regain crucial soft power it had lost earlier. Given the widespread use of both Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines, its efforts seem to be working.

The attribution of soft power to vaccines has led to a certain degree of symbolism attached to them as well. Western states have been reluctant to sanction the usage of Chinese vaccines and vice versa – this is reflected wholly by the travel restrictions held by states across the world. Where in China, local vaccines enable fluid travel, they severely restrict the opportunity for travel in Western states – similarly, Western vaccines restrict travel in China but enable free travel in Western states. This reflects a dangerous trend, wherein vaccines are being used as a diplomatic tool to curb travel, and in turn, ties between states. As long as the international community does not come to a consensus with regards to vaccination and travel, there will remain a rather dismal outlook on the future of travel, wherein the world will be drawn on political fault lines defined by vaccinations. 

Through its diversification of vaccine sources, Bangladesh has continued to insist on its nature of non-alignment in the international community. At least in regards to the current search for vaccines, this is a strategy that has paid off. It has ensured we do not succumb to the endeavours of power of states, and it has also ensured that our citizens are not trapped by virtue of the vaccine they have taken thanks to the wide availability of choices depending on their situation. However, it is also important for Bangladesh to think of the long term – as a country that is making use of vaccines from around the world and across the board, it could play a unique role in encouraging a more equitable and inclusive geopolitical reality with vaccines. Through building consensus between states with regards to vaccination, the world could very well avoid the divided reality of vaccine diplomacy that remains frighteningly possible today. It must also consider its own independence in this world – independence that is best sought through the local production (or co-production) of vaccines, as has been evidenced by government plans to produce generic vaccines and co-produce Sinopharm and Sputnik doses.

Vaccines are a merit good – they are something that all people ought to have access to, particularly during this pandemic. The role they play in the diplomatic front could very well ensure that countless lives are saved through equitable access and inclusive vaccine policies. To reduce them to an easily manipulated tool for power would needlessly take them away from their true purpose and only deepen the international faultlines of today. Bangladesh has taken many applaudable steps in this budding new field, but it must also be prepared to carve out a positive international reality with the rest of the world – a reality that can continue to save countless lives.

2022/0023,Article,https://www.newagebd.net/article/146056/discriminatory-vaccine-diplomacy-of-west,"WITH the coronavirus pandemic, ‘vaccine diplomacy’ has become a significant factor in international life. Before the coronavirus pandemic, the tools of diplomacy were mostly lucrative loans, customs concessions, scientific and cultural exchanges. Yet now, vaccines have been added to these tools, and the diplomatic effect has been far more significant than anyone could have anticipated. First of all, it has a disproportionately more substantial influence on minds and has, therefore, become very actively used primarily by western countries, that have tried in a blatantly unscrupulous struggle to actively hinder the certification and recognition of the Russian vaccine ‘Sputnik V’ in international markets, and instead push their vaccine, although from the beginning many western vaccines have come under fire from western media for the negative and even deadly consequences.

In addition, ‘vaccine diplomacy’ has been increasingly used by leading vaccine monopoly countries to promote their advantage and strengthen their global expansion. This was especially evident in the propaganda rhetoric of individual media outlets, which tried to show in blatantly paid articles how a ‘big country’ that provides a small country with a vaccine becomes a much more important partner than the other countries that seemed so important before the pandemic. That is, the use of ‘soft power’ has unfolded in all its glory.

It is also worth noting the fact that vaccine diplomacy affects the powerful caste of today’s Golden Billion: from doctors, who are used to making good money from clinical trials, to pharmaceutical manufacturers, who are used to selling their products with excessive profits. And this is especially evident in the activities of Pfizer and Moderna, which are demanding businesses laden with a vast number of shareholders, loans, and liabilities, and whose profits have grown exorbitantly as a result of ‘vaccine diplomacy.’ For example, Moderna, a US pharmaceutical company that makes a vaccine for Covid-19, reported a 65-fold increase in revenue for the second quarter of 2021 to $4.4 billion, with a net profit of nearly $3 billion. On August 1, anti-Covid drug manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna, as the Financial Times reports, referring to the parts of the contracts in its possession, raised the price per dose for the European Union, even though earlier scientists on the website medRxiv said that the effectiveness of the vaccine Pfizer had lowered.

And so western diplomacy, which has lived with racial discrimination for centuries, especially in Anglo-Saxon countries, and is used to dividing people along racial, national, or class lines, has decided to take up ‘vaccine diplomacy’ to further officially divide the world’s population.

US president Joe Biden, usually relatively restrained in terms of harsh rhetoric, recently staged an apparent provocation, notes Handelsblatt. He spoke of a pandemic of the unvaccinated, suggesting the guilt of those who refuse to roll up their sleeves and get vaccinated. It is this debate that western societies are now engaged in with increasing urgency. Ultimately, it is a question of what rights vaccinated citizens will have and what rights unvaccinated citizens will be deprived of. As a result, a two-class society of vaccinated and cured people on one side and unvaccinated people on the other has long been a reality, notes the publication. For example, Italy is introducing a compulsory ‘green passport,’ and to visit almost all public places (in particular, theatres, concerts, museums, swimming pools, sporting events, exhibitions, and the interior of catering facilities) will require at least one vaccination, confirmation of a previous illness or a negative test for Covid-19, which was made not earlier than 48 hours before it is presented. These restrictions may also apply to ships, long-distance trains, and aircraft (although the government has not yet reached an agreement), reports the publication. For those who refuse to be vaccinated, life can get pretty expensive, so it is not surprising that thousands of people have been protesting this two-class society in recent weeks.

A document that will be an entrance ticket to many areas of public life in France is the ‘health passport,’ which since July 21 is mandatory for attendance at all recreational and cultural events with more than 50 participants.

In the UK, the National Health Service app has been offering a digital Covid pass for days. The government considers making the Covid pass mandatory for entry to nightclubs and other establishments starting in October. However, a decision has not yet been made, as there is considerable resistance among the Conservatives in the House of Commons.

Tough times are coming for unvaccinated people in Greece as well. The interiors of restaurants, cinemas, and theatres are now only open to visitors who have had Covid-19 within the last six months and can confirm that they were vaccinated at least 14 days ago. They must also provide a QR code confirmation from the national health authority.

In the US, vaccinated people are already privileged: New York City has required restaurants, bars, gyms, and other establishments to check customers’ vaccination certificates. ‘If you want to participate fully in public life, you need to get vaccinated,’ New York City mayor Bill de Blasio pointed out. The New York real estate developer Related plans to fire employees who have not had at least one vaccination by the end of August. In addition, the US may require foreign nationals entering the country to be vaccinated, White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator, Jeff Zients said.

However, most companies and countries do not give much thought to compulsory vaccination because it is legally questionable. Many governments also oppose compulsory vaccination except for certain professions, such as care for the sick and elderly and catering.

Fear of a pandemic wave caused by the ‘Delta’ variant of the coronavirus indeed defines mass vaccination of the population of countries as the leading way to combat Covid-19. However, this work should not be conducted in the form of a new division of society into classes but through increased advocacy with respect for human rights and international norms. Convincing people to get vaccinated against coronavirus without resorting to mandated vaccination should be a top priority to avoid more victims suffering from a coronavirus pandemic.",https://www.newagebd.com/files/records/news/202108/146056_154.jpg,"Aug 12,2021",NewAge,Discriminatory ‘vaccine diplomacy’ of west,
2022/0024,Article,https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2021/12/06/bangladeshs-vaccine-policy-cooperation-beyond-geopolitical-lens/,"Since its outbreak, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented devastation to every nook and corner of the world. Not being just a cataclysmic health crisis, the pandemic is subtly but substantially reshaping social norms, economic systems, diplomacy way-outs, as well as global leadership and rivalry. As of now, experts believe that this deadly virus is not going to completely disappear overnight rather will remain as a recurring event like the normal flu virus. However, acquiring herd immunity which insists on mass inoculation is the most acceptable solution to combat the worsening situation.

The world is becoming unable to meet the demands of the massive number of vaccines as only a handful of wealthy nations are producing them. In the wake of the current condition, every country, either rich or poor has its own game to play, rich ones for achieving so-called ‘vaccine nationalism’ and the poor ones for maintaining proper channel to procure them. As if conquering the pandemic bears testimony to not only a country’s economy and resources but also its strategy and diplomatic prudence.

By now, it is evident that Coronavirus traits are very complex as unpredictable mutations of it can jump back and forth across the globe. Today’s successful COVID-19 players might be a victim of tomorrow’s worst-hit outbreaks. For instance, the overconfidence emanating from India’s temporary triumph over vaccine manufacture caused sufferings for more than 90 countries. It is understandable why India’s worsening situation led to the failure of delivering 30 million vaccine doses as per a deal with Bangladesh. However, it was unfair not to deliver even a single dose after the sudden halt on vaccine export, for which Bangladesh has paid in advance.

Due to some unavoidable factors, for Bangladesh, Serum was the only feasible and proximate option for vaccines. Firstly, Bangladesh continued consistent efforts to keep all the alternate options simultaneously within the reach. Some of the vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna require extremely cold refrigeration which in terms of both storage capacity and commercial viability is untenable. WHO/GAVI backed initiative COVAX Facility has been proved inadequate to respond to the demand worldwide equally. Secondly, due to long term and consistent G2G liaison between Sheikh Hasina and the Modi Government, Bangladesh ranked the Indian source at the initial ladder. But it didn’t mean Bangladesh subsequently closed other avenues for future exigency. Thirdly, India’s initially successful ‘vaccine diplomacy’ was so overwhelming that it seemed India was just a step behind from becoming a ‘vaccine hegemony’ worldwide.

Over the sudden upside-down flip of India, Bangladesh had to make desperate diplomatic efforts to procure vaccines for which China and Russia nodded positively. Bangladesh inked a non-disclosure deal of 15 million Sinopharm doses with China. Also, Bangladesh received two consignments of 1.1 million of Chinese Sinopharm doses as gift. Up until now, Bangladesh is hopeful of joining to the China-led initiative of vaccine storage facility and collaboration with Russia to produce Sputnik V locally.

In such a pandemic situation when co-operation is urgent rather than competition, geostrategic gambit should not predominate in the South Asian region which is home to around 25% of the global population. As for Bangladesh, being densely populated with a population of more than 170 million, it is highly vulnerable to the risk of COVID-19 expansion and mutation due to acute intra and inter-regional people to people contact, if this particular region remains less inoculated. Currently, Bangladesh only needs 1.6 million AstraZeneca doses to continue the inoculation program that kicked off on February 7, 2021. Also, a burgeoning economy like Bangladesh, can afford to purchase sufficient vaccine doses as well as manufacture them locally. Not only that, Bangladesh should be called for particular attention for a full-fledged vaccine production scheme, as COVID-19 vaccines are considered as ‘global public goods.’

Despite not having a remarkable health policy, so far, Bangladesh has responded much better compared to other countries in South Asia regarding COVID-19 management. However, the condition might flip over uncanny circumstances anytime soon. Therefore, any vaccine procurement initiative should look through the prism of exigency, not preference for their allies, as downpour of misery on one corner is a failure to the entire globe.",https://moderndiplomacy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/india-covid-19-vaccine.jpg,"December 6, 2021",modern diplomacy,Bangladesh’s Vaccine Policy: Cooperation beyond Geopolitical Lens,
2022/0025,Article,https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2021/05/02/covid-19-vaccine-diplomacy-bangladeshs-perspective/,"The vaccination campaign in Bangladesh is set to suffer a major setback. The Serum Institute of India, the only source of Covid-19 vaccines for Bangladesh to date, cannot export vaccines anytime soon due to the export ban imposed by the Indian government. Currently, India is grappling with an unprecedented Covid-19 crisis with more than 300,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths every day. The country of 1.3 billion people has recorded a staggering total of 18 million infections and 200,000 deaths so far. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Indian government trying to protect its people from the deadly virus has imposed an export ban on vaccines.  

India’s decision not to send vaccines to other countries comes as a big blow for Bangladesh since the country only relied on vaccines provided by Serum. As per an agreement signed in December last year, the Bangladesh government was supposed to receive 30 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine named Covishield from Serum. Although Serum was supposed to provide 5 million doses per month,Bangladesh has received only 7 million doses in two instalments while another 3.2 million was sent as a gift by Delhi.  

Official figures suggest that Bangladesh rolled out mass inoculation on 7 February with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and so far, nearly 5.78 million people have received the first jab. Around 3.5 million people are yet to get their second dose, but the government only has approximately 2 million doses in hand. According to the health officials, at the current rate of use, the vaccine stock of the country could run out within two weeks. This is indeed a big blow for the country in its fight against the grim pandemic. According to media reports published in March this year, Bangladesh is supposed to receive almost 10 million shots under the global arrangement called COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX). However, it is also not clear when these vaccines will reach Bangladesh.

Now, uncertainty looms around Covid-19 vaccination in Bangladesh when it passes through the worst phase of the pandemic with nearly 100 daily casualties. Although Bangladesh has tried to get the vaccines from India through diplomatic efforts, one can assume that the problem is not being solved. India has admitted its inability to export the rest of the promised vaccines. Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has said that it may not send the rest of the vaccines before June/July until the situation improves in India. However, to ensure a second dose for everyone, Bangladesh has to keep negotiating with Serum to bring at least 2 million vials by the end of May if it is not possible to get 8 million doses for which Bangladesh has paid in advance. If necessary, Bangladesh has to communicate at the highest level.

Although late, Bangladesh has finally started to engage in vaccine diplomacy coming out of Indian influence. In a multilateral effort to ensure vaccine and oxygen supply among the countries, Bangladesh has recently joined the China-led initiative, called “China-South Asia Platform for Covid-19 consultation, Cooperation, and Post-Pandemic Economic Recovery. The first virtual meeting of this cooperation was recently joined by the foreign ministers of Bangladesh, China, Nepal, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan. Several vital issues, such as establishing a Covid Emergency Medical Facility, a Poverty Alleviation Centre, and exploring e-commerce in rural areas in Bangladesh, were discussed in the meeting. However, it is just the beginning, and there are no solid plans yet on how to execute it, but it should be seen as a good opportunity from Bangladesh’s perspective.

The vaccine nationalism has placed several countries, especially the developing and underdeveloped ones,in a dire situation, and Bangladesh is no exception. The world has been witnessing a growing divide between the Global North and Global South on the proper distribution of vaccines. It is indeed a matter of great regret that some nations are waiting and groaning for inoculation campaign when a few developed countries have control over most of the vaccines. The profit-seeking behaviour of vaccine manufacturing countries and companies and global politics regarding the same are the issues the world would least want to see during this unprecedented crisis. Many international experts believe that Western country’s monopoly on vaccine production is the reason behind Russia’s Sputnik V and China’s Sinopharm vaccines not getting World Health Organization’s approval yet.  

It was conceivable that the superpowers would be in fierce competition with each other over vaccine production since vaccine became a global hotspot of global diplomacy triggered by the competitive nature of the existing world order. On the other hand, for the Indian government, it seems a daunting task to vaccinate the 1.3 billion population, and it is too unfair to think that the country will be able to provide timely delivery of vaccines to other countries before meeting its internal demand. In addition, keeping the shortage of vaccines and the quick mutating nature of the virus in mind, it was injudicious for the Bangladesh government not to consider alternative sources. However, it is better late than never. Still, Bangladesh can prepare itself to face the impending danger by taking lessons from previous mistakes.

The country now needs to focus on a few important issues to tackle this grim pandemic. First of all, the government’s decision to not looking for alternative sources of vaccines was baffling. Meanwhile, to avoid a similar situation in future, the country should not put all its eggs in one basket this time. The government has recently given nod to both China’s Sinopharm and Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine to mitigate the ongoing vaccine crisis- good riddance. Provided vaccines from both Russia and China are safe and effective, the government also needs to emphasize on developing local manufacturing capability at the earliest possible time. This is because there is no guarantee that Russia and China will keep supplying vaccines to Bangladesh in time. Therefore, local production could be a durable solution.

Secondly, Bangladesh may even go beyond China and Russia’s assistance to ensure timely vaccination for its most vulnerable people. One of the advisers to U.S. President Joe Biden has said that that they will share six crores Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines from its stockpiles with other countries, and India will get preference given the current condition of the country. Therefore, it is the right time for Bangladesh to ramp up diplomatic efforts to ensure that it also receives some vaccines from the U.S. 

Thirdly, next time when vaccines from a new brand arrive, the responsible authority must ensure that it keeps sufficient vials for those yet to receive their second dose before giving people the first dose. According to the experts, it would not be wise to inoculate people with different brands without any concrete study. Without confirming the second dose for those who took the first one, Bangladesh shouldn’t have allowed others to take the first shot. Now, if the required vaccines do not arrive early, there is a chance that a considerable number of people will have to take their second jab late.

Lastly, it’s time for the government to think seriously about coping with its oxygen shortage. There is no better example for Bangladesh now than India’s current situation, where the latter is grappling with an oxygen shortage. India used to provide 15-20 per cent of Bangladesh’s monthly requirement of around 5,400 tonnes of medical and industrial oxygen. Since India is halting supply, oxygen crunch may turn grave in the upcoming days. Health experts have warned that if the current situation deteriorates to something close to what India has been witnessing, the existing capacity may be overwhelmed to control the situation. Moreover, suppose the Indian ban on oxygen export continues for a long period. In that case, Bangladesh cannot help but seek assistance from countries such as Singapore for the required oxygen supply, which may increase the cost as well as time.

As we have witnessed India’s dire situation due to the second wave, it is also possible that due to a surge in cases, hospitals in Bangladesh may crumble similarly under the strain of new patients who would badly need uninterrupted oxygen supply. Therefore, besides imports, it is high time the government seek assistance from other countries to churn out more oxygen within the country before it experiences the grave consequences of the second wave. Along with vaccines, ensuring uninterrupted oxygen supply is no less important. The government needs proper planning to protect its citizens from the second and possibly the third wave in the upcoming days.

2022/0028,Article,https://apolitical.co/solution-articles/en/soft-power-and-vaccine-diplomacy-what-can-we-learn,"Production, distribution and control of Covid-19 vaccines has created dilemmas and opportunities for states who exercise soft power in their international relations — and even allowed new players to emerge.

Soft power is the ability to make change through persuasion and influence instead of coercion. In the state’s toolbox, it sits between public diplomacy, corporate diplomacy, and statecraft. For these reasons, how much soft power a country can exert depends on its policies, corporations, and citizens, who must work together to ensure that the effect remains positive.

Aid, health, education, entertainment, branding of products, and tourism have all traditionally offered states opportunities to exercise soft power. But the Covid-19 pandemic has distorted what is perceived as influential. In the early stages of the pandemic, many thought vaccine diplomacy would enable particular countries to make substantial geopolitical gains.

An opportunity for regional diplomacy
Regional peacekeeping is high on the list for nations seeking to make gains through vaccine diplomacy. But we must keep in mind that when this pandemic ends (and it will end), new geopolitical loyalties will be made.

India is a manufacturer for the COVAX consortium under Gavi, the vaccine alliance, which has 92 countries under its umbrella. It has permission to manufacture the UK’s AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine under the brand name Covishield. Through its Vaccine Maitri (Vaccine Friendship) campaign, which began on January 16, 2021, India has donated vaccines to the United Nations’ ‘blue helmets’ peacekeepers, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, and Nepal. It planned to send more to regional neighbours. In addition to this, through other schemes, India plans to supply 76 countries with 60.4 million doses of its produced vaccine (including its indigenous Covaxin). Bhutan occupies a strategic place between India and China. In a feat of diplomatic adroitness, Bhutan got a grant from India and vaccinated 93% of its population in 16 days.

The European Union also used vaccines in its regional diplomacy strategy when it sent BioNTech/Pfizer doses to non-EU Balkan states to stave off interest from both China and Russia in the region. Finally, the United States, India, Japan, and Australia created the Quad Vaccine Collaboration to counter China’s influence in Southeast Asia.

""Soft power during Covid-19 has changed the political landscape. It has brought to the forefront new patterns of regional alignment and the power of barter during times of crisis. These short-term tactics will have long-term implications on the future.""

Bartering for access to vaccines
In a highly uncertain environment, bartering has become the norm for countries seeking to gain access to limited supplies. Early on, South Korea helped the USA access masks and testing kits, and there was a hope that this would lead to a reciprocal arrangement in terms of vaccines. Israel traded data on its population (excluding Palestinians in Occupied Territories) to get a priority shipment of Pfizer-BioNtech vaccines. Israel paid for Sputnik vaccines from Russia for Syria, purportedly for a prisoner release. Both Russia and Israel are heavily involved in the Syrian conflict, which has been ongoing since 2011 and is responsible for displacing more refugees than World War II.

Venezuela has offered oil to inoculate its populations. The United Arab Emirates became a testing ground for the Sinopharm vaccine in September 2020. It became the first Gulf country to produce the vaccines under a joint collaboration with Sinopharm called ‘Hayat-Vax’ in April, 2021, to address the global shortage, especially in the Middle East and Africa.

Countries prioritise their needs over global citizenship
Coronavirus diplomacy has created a ‘us versus them’ dynamic in international relations. Many states made pre-purchase agreements with vaccine producers, such that 51% of the global supply was reserved for 14% of the world population as of November 2020. This led to a policy of prioritization for national needs.

As I mentioned before, India is one of the suppliers for COVAX and has shipped close to 18 million vaccines mostly manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII). India is contractually responsible for 64 countries in particular. But its strategy of prioritising vaccine exports to neighbours in pursuit of geopolitical gains — instead of vaccinating its own population first — has backfired. Faced with a new virus strain, it has seen a sharp increase in cases and deaths. India halted or stopped exports to the UK, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Morocco, focusing instead on increasing its 2% vaccination rate. It has reversed its “Make India Self Reliant” policy, and has now allowed other vaccines from Russia, the US, and Europe into the country as the situation spirals out of control.

How Covid-19 changed the soft power landscape
In some ways, vaccine diplomacy has created new opportunities and dilemmas for states that use soft power. The EU’s threat to stop production of the UK’s AstraZeneca vaccine by blocking its EU-based supply chain may lead to more ethnocentric policies for future global disasters. Meanwhile, Australia had shut its border, criminalising the return of its citizens from India to protect those living in Australia. It chose to exclude one segment of citizens by law: albeit in an emergency situation.

We have also seen chaos as local governments grapple with the policies of central governments. When there is a lack of focus on one’s own citizens, other countries rush to exert power. For example, Russia has made entry into Germany, with the state of Bavaria signing a letter of intent for Sputnik vaccines. So we may see the beginning of cities and regions exerting their own brand of soft power across the world.

India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh’s Sheikh Hasina met in a virtual summit Thursday -- the first high-level meeting of the leaders from the two countries since relations nosedived when India passed its controversial religion-based citizenship law late last year.

“India and Bangladesh are cooperating well on the Covid vaccine,” Modi said at the summit’s inauguration, adding that New Delhi “will pay special attention” to Bangladesh’s immunization requirements.

Hasina said the two countries can move up global value chains by further integrating their economies. She also announced the inauguration of the Chilahati-Haldibari trans-border railway link between the countries that had stopped functioning in 1965.

Modi Finds Neighbors Silent As India-China Tensions Simmer

Last December Bangladesh’s foreign minister AK Abdul Momen and home minister Asaduzzaman Khan had both called off visits after nationwide protests erupted in India against its new citizen law. The new law fast-tracks Indian citizenship for non-Muslims from three neighboring nations including Bangladesh.

New Delhi has since been making overtures to smoothen relations with Dhaka, with whom it has a long history of cooperative ties.

Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla visited Bangladesh twice this year. The second visit in August came amid rising border tensions with China, which has committed $40 billion in investments in Bangladesh.

On Thursday the two countries signed seven agreements relating to trade, energy and agriculture. Annual trade between India and Bangladesh stood at $10.25 billion in the fiscal year ended March 2019, Indian government data shows.

New Weather Patterns Are Turning Water Into a Weapon

A joint statement released after the meetings said that Hasina highlighted the need for the early signing of an interim agreement on sharing the waters of the Teesta river. Modi too reiterated India’s “sincere commitment and continued efforts” to reach an agreement on the dispute that has lingered since the 80s.

Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and his counterpart Momen had committed to finalizing an interim deal in September.

The “long-drawn failure to sign the Teesta river water agreement” and the new citizenship law have together “unsettled public opinion in Bangladesh” against New Delhi despite decades of close ties, said Delwar Hossain, a professor of international relations at Dhaka University. “Now Covid-19 has brought the two nations together once again.”

Bangladesh’s Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd. signed an agreement with Serum Institute of India Pvt. in November for 30 million vaccine doses, shortly after India’s Jaishankar committed supplies to Dhaka during his meeting with Momen.

About a half, or 6.4 billion, of the 12.5 billion doses the main vaccine producers have so far planned to produce in 2021, have already been pre-ordered, mostly by wealthy countries, accounting for only around 13 per cent of the global population. The 27 European Union members and five other rich countries also have options, written into contracts, to order extra doses.

Australia and Canada have secured supplies equivalent to five times their population. Israel has reportedly paid far more than other countries to secure doses of the Pfizer vaccine.

Poor countries simply cannot afford or compete.

 

Big Pharma’s defence of IPRs

BIG Pharma leaders have been quick to express their opposition to the developing country proposal to temporarily suspend the World Trade Organisation’s agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights to allow manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs. They warned that allowing their COVID-19 vaccines to be copied through compulsory licensing ‘would undermine innovation and raise the risk of unsafe viruses.’

Big Pharma leaders also were lukewarm to the idea of patent pools such as the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) of the World Health Organisation despite a lot of support from low- and middle-income countries.

Opposing C-TAP, Thomas Cueni, the director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, falsely claimed, ‘there’s never been a need for compulsory licensing of vaccine patents in the history of IP.’

‘IP is a fundamental part of our industry’, insisted the AstraZeneca executive director and CEO Pascal Soriot. ‘And if you don’t protect IP, then essentially there’s no incentive for anybody to innovate.’

Pfizer’s chairman and CEO Albert Bourla said that with hundreds of biotechs investing billions of dollars in vaccine development, having someone say that they are going to take that IP is dangerous, ignoring the fact that pharmaceutical companies received billions of dollars of tax-payers’ money.

The European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and other developed countries opposed the TRIPS waiver request at the behest of Big Pharma.

 

IPRs, theft by law

IRONICALLY, while the case for more openness in sharing knowledge is compelling, ‘neo-liberals’ who claim to oppose monopolies and related market abuses and distortions be for freeing markets and promoting competition have effectively extended and strengthened property rights and attendant monopolies.

Powerful corporate and developed economy government lobbies have influenced the IPR regime, eg, by opposing competing rights associated with nature, biodiversity or even traditional knowledge.

Strictly enforced IPRs protection at the international level is, in fact, historically new. Recent free trade agreements have sought to extend IPRs to cover ‘biologics’, eg, naturally occurring substances, such as insulin derived from mammals, needed by those suffering from diabetes.

Thus, the evolving and still growing IP regime has increasingly protected patents over the past few decades. The regime serves to maximise profits for a few monopolies, eg, Big Pharma, rather than enhance the progress, interests and welfare of the many.

 

Pfizer at forefront of IPRs

‘The [intellectual property], which is the blood of the private sector, is what brought a solution to this pandemic and it is not a barrier right now’, said the chief executive of Pfizer in opposing the TRIPS waiver. Incidentally, Pfizer’s the then chairman Edmund Pratt played a leading role in TRIPS that coincided with the triumph of the neoliberalism in the mid-1980s.

Pratt served on the advisory committee on trade negotiations for both Carter and Reagan administrations. In 1986, he co-founded the Intellectual Property Committee, built relationships with industries across Europe and Japan, met officials from the World Intellectual Property Organisation of the United Nations and lobbied aggressively — with the mission of ensuring that strong IPRs were included in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks that would result in the establishment of the WTO in 1995.

Pratt had powerful allies, including IBM chairman John Opel. Furthermore, he could enrol the support of former Pfizer executives who later occupied key positions in strategic business organisations for a trade-based approach to intellectual property.

Many developing countries resisted such inclusion on grounds that stronger intellectual property rules would protect the monopoly power of corporations and undermine domestic price controls. But Pratt and his allies’ efforts succeeded in securing the inclusion of TRIPS.

OECD countries pushed very hard to broaden the scope of WTO membership commitments to TRIPS at the 1997 ministerial meeting in Singapore. Despite clear developing country misgivings, US president Clinton continued to press for more TRIPS commitments at the 1999 Seattle WTO ministerial, triggering an African walkout.

The WTO agreement on TRIPS has greatly strengthened and extended IPRs for multinational companies and their home governments. TRIPS requires WTO members, including developing countries, to adopt a US-type patent and copy right rule.

Previously, countries could have whatever rules they wanted. For instance, India which already had a well-developed pharmaceutical industry by the 1990s did not allow drug companies to patent drugs. Pre-TRIPS, they could patent processes only.

               

Developed country hypocrisy

Incredibly, most developed countries opposing temporary TRIPS suspension have provisions in their own IP laws to suspend patent protection on various grounds related to national interest and public health emergencies.

For example, Canada, Germany and France strengthened their patent laws to issue compulsory licences for COVID-19 vaccines and drugs. European Council president Charles Michel has explicitly said that the EU could adopt ‘urgent measures’ by invoking an emergency provision in the EU treaties in response to supply shortfalls. Article 122 of the EU Treaty could be used to force vaccine makers to share their patents or other licences.

Section 55 of the UK Patents Act 1977 entitles the government to sell, or offer to sell, a patented product like specific drugs, medicines, or medical devices, without the consent of the patentee, to deal with emergencies.

In the United States, although there is no legislation on administrative order and compulsory licensing, 28 US Code Sec 1498 (a) enables the government to make or use any invention without the patentee’s permission.

The Bayh-Dole Act created ‘march-in rights’ that allows the government to require the owner or exclusive licensee of a patent, created with federal funding, to grant a third party a licence to an invention under certain conditions. This is especially relevant now as Trump’s Operation Warp Speed was crucial for the accelerated development of COVID-19 vaccines, most notably Moderna’s.

When avian flu threatened much of the world early this century, the US was the only country in the world to issue four compulsory licences to US manufacturers to produce Tamiflu to protect its entire population of around 300 million. Ironically, it was not used as no birds brought the influenza over the Pacific or Atlantic Oceans.

The newest entry to the pandemic lexicon might be “vaccine diplomacy”, with some countries using their jabs to strengthen regional ties and enhance their own power and global status.

In early February, half a million doses of the Chinese Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Pakistan, before soon also reaching 13 other countries including Cambodia, Nepal, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe. The Chinese ambassador to Pakistan declared it a “manifestation of our brotherhood”, a sentiment echoed by the Pakistani government. Russia has similarly used its own Sputnik V vaccine to win friends and support, providing access to countries as yet unable to start their own vaccination programmes.

India has been donating supplies of the AstraZeneca/Oxford jabs produced in the country to regional neighbours including Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal, bolstering not only its reputation as a supplier of cheap and accessible vaccines to the global south, but also challenging China’s efforts at regional dominance at a time of heightened tensions between the two countries.

Meanwhile, Israel has reportedly agreed to pay Russia to send the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine to the Syrian government as part of a prisoner exchange deal.


Vaccine diplomacy has also involved efforts to undermine trust in the intentions and efficacy of rival powers. China and Russia have both been accused by governments in Europe and North America of state-backed disinformation campaigns seeking to undermine trust in vaccines produced in those regions. And Russia sent supplies of Sputnik V to Hungary, in a move seen by some as designed to undermine EU unity and credibility.

Europe and North America have been late to the game in providing vaccines to poorer countries and regions. Calls from leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron to donate vaccines to poorer countries, and pledges from the UK to donate surplus supplies have only emerged in recent days.

Strings attached?
In the absence of providing vaccine supplies to poorer countries, some in the west sought to cast doubt on the credibility of Chinese and Russian efforts, presenting them as cynical ploys for diplomatic advantage. You may be getting vaccines, they have been telling the world, but at what cost in your obligations to Russia and China – even as western countries wrap their own international aid in conditions, often involving aspirations for trade deals.

The response to the virus has been embedded in global power and diplomatic wrangles from the very start – from the Trump administration referring to “the Chinese virus” at every turn as part of its wider political and economic struggles with China, to Chinese efforts to use its own success to enhance the legitimacy of strict measures and curbs on political and social freedoms.

Fighting disease has in fact long been used as a means for extending soft power and winning friends.

Superpower rivalries for influence through the needle have sometimes even been positive: the success of the smallpox eradication campaign was in part fuelled by the rivalry between the Soviet Union and US. Responding to the Sars epidemic in 2002, China provided assistance and support to affected countries to bolster its global power status, including to Taiwan. This stands in stark contrast to its more tense relationship with Taiwan in this latest epidemic.

Such assistance has tended to accrue the most soft-power influence when aid has been seen as impartial and free from naked self-interest. Before being merged with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, for example, the reputation of the UK’s former Department for International Development (DfID) was in part enhanced by its legally enshrined focus on poverty and its autonomous status. The current round of vaccine diplomacy on all sides is neither.The prospect of global health becoming a new arena for global power competition and rivalry should worry us all. Whatever benefits may have emerged from such rivalries in the past, they did so through cooperative rivalry. The global response to COVID-19 has thus far tended to be uncooperative and divisive, casting blame or seeking to spread distrust.The complexities of global health, and the needs of the billions excluded from the benefits of vaccine science and innovation, demand a truly global response. Whether responding to COVID-19 will lead to a more equal partnership for health for all, or reinforce some of the worst instincts displayed during the past year, will determine not only the course of COVID-19, but the impact of the next epidemic to threaten global health, and the ones that follow that.","https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2021-02/19/full/1613755665-1296.jpg?im=Resize,width=640              https://images.theconversation.com/files/385538/original/file-20210222-15-1qvu06p.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&h=503&fit=crop&dpr=1    ","February 23, 2021",Business Standard,How 'vaccine diplomacy' is helping some countries bolster their soft power,
2022/0032,Article,https://www.thedailystar.net/views/opinion/news/the-vaccine-apartheid-must-end-2181061,"Vaccine costs have pushed many developing countries to the end of the Covid-19 inoculation queue, with most low-income nations not even lining up. What's worse, less vaccinated poor nations cannot afford fiscal efforts to provide relief or stimulate recovery—let alone achieve Agenda 2030.

Excluding by appropriating

Developing countries now account for more than 85 percent of global pandemic deaths. By early September, The Economist estimated actual Covid-19 deaths worldwide at 15.2 million, rather than the official 4.6 million.

In six of the 10 countries with the highest fatality rates, less than a 10th of their populations were fully vaccinated as of August 10. In the other four, no more than a third were fully vaccinated.

Now, as rich nations buy up more vaccines for third shots, vaccination inequities are becoming starker. Buying up hundreds of millions of doses, they penalise poorer countries who are already doubly deprived. Rich countries will likely have about 1.2 billion extra doses by the end of 2021!

More than 5.41 billion vaccine shots have been administered worldwide, with 81 percent in only 10 high and upper middle-income countries. Meanwhile, the poorest countries have only received 0.4 percent.

In January, the World Health Organization (WHO) director-general voiced caution: ""I need to be blunt: the world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure—and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries.""

Profits booster

In early July, Pfizer and BioNTech announced plans to get emergency authorisation for booster vaccine doses. Pfizer then met with US officials to press their case, while Moderna applied for approval this month.

Following the Israeli president's third shot on July 30, nearly a million boosters have been administered in the US since August 12, despite earlier official hesitation. US President Joe Biden expects to launch a campaign for a further 100 million booster shots this month.

France began administering boosters to people over 65 years old from September. The UK has announced offering a third dose from late September. Germany, Belgium and other European countries followed suit.

Now, the vaccine supply will decline further as Pfizer and Moderna sell booster doses. Two new Pfizer-BioNTech facilities have been approved to manufacture boosters in France and Germany. Meanwhile, Moderna is scaling up booster production in Massachusetts and New Hampshire in the US. Almost all the 3.2 billion Pfizer and Moderna doses to be produced this year have already been purchased by the US and Europe.

The WHO DG lambasted this ""scandalous inequity"" at the World Health Assembly in May. The UN health agency has repeatedly called for delaying booster provision, arguing that the most vulnerable people worldwide should be vaccinated first.

Pfizer and Moderna have not provided details on their booster prices. An economist has estimated that, sold at present prices, the booster shot sale would represent roughly a 50 percent increase in revenue over the longer run.

Moderna raised its 2021 vaccine sales forecast for its first two doses to USD 19.2 billion in May. So, booster sales should add about USD 10 billion. Meanwhile, Pfizer raised its own forecast by more than 70 percent to USD 26 billion, with booster sales bringing USD 13 billion more.

Profits over science

Rich countries' practices actually go against most of the scientific advice. The case for boosters is not scientifically established. The majority of scientists do not agree that boosters are the best way to deal with new threats. Citing lack of credible data, scientists have opposed boosters in reputable journals, including Nature.

On August 6, the European Union's drugs regulator noted that there was not enough evidence to recommend Covid-19 vaccine boosters. A European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control report this month affirmed that ""there is no urgent need"" for booster shots, except for those in frail health.

The WHO noted on August 18 that the current data did not support the case for booster shots. Scientists described official decisions approving third booster shots as ""shocking"" and ""criminal."" When US authorities approved boosters, two top vaccine officials quit in protest.

Independent research on Pfizer's two-dose vaccine suggests that it provides long-term immunity for years, contrary to the company's latest claims. Also using mRNA technology, Moderna's vaccine should have similar longer-term efficacy.

As Covid-19 vaccines are still new, such expectations remain subject to confirmation. As with most vaccines, ""memory response"" triggers antibody protection when someone vaccinated is infected, even after natural response levels have waned.

Perhaps most worryingly, as big pharmaceutical companies transform their business strategies to generate more profits from boosters, their incentives change. They have less reason to develop vaccines fully immunising against the Covid-19 virus, or even to ensure that everyone is vaccinated.

Apartheid booster

Supplying boosters reduces vaccines available to others. Supplies to poorer countries have already been greatly reduced by rich countries securing many times more than what their populations need.

Some have even abused the COVAX scheme, which is purportedly designed for equitable distribution of vaccine doses to poorer countries. COVAX aimed to deliver a billion vaccine doses in 2021, but had only delivered 217 million by August, according to Unicef.

Meanwhile, many rich countries continue to block the request to the World Trade Organization to temporarily suspend Covid-related intellectual property rights. This waiver would enable developing countries to affordably produce tests, vaccines, treatments, equipment, and other such needs.

Earlier, Big Pharma leaders rejected WHO's Covid-19 Technology Access Tool (C-TAP) initiative to share technologies and research knowledge in order to accelerate affordable production of and access to such technologies—terming the initiative ""nonsense.""

Vaccine equity necessary

There is also a practical reason behind seeking vaccine equity. We are all safer when everyone is vaccinated. New, more vaccine-resistant variants are emerging, endangering everyone. Rich countries protecting their own citizens will not prevent new mutants from emerging. New infections risk triggering a resurgence with new, more dangerous mutations.

The Delta variant, first reported in India in late 2020, surged in March as few there had been vaccinated. Ironically, the Serum Institute of India has the world's largest vaccine production capacity by far, but it has been largely underutilised for Covid-19 vaccines.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warns that highly infectious variants could derail economic recovery, cutting global output by USD 4.5 trillion by 2025. But the Economist Intelligence Unit estimated the world economy could lose USD 2.3 trillion in 2021 alone, due to delayed vaccinations, with developing nations losing most.

As the WHO DG said: ""Vaccine inequity is the world's biggest obstacle to ending this pandemic and recovering from Covid-19… Economically, epidemiologically and morally, it is in all countries' best interest to use the latest available data to make life-saving vaccines available to all.""",https://images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_202/public/images/2021/09/21/vaccine-shortage-covid-19.jpg,"Sep 22, 2021",The Daily Star,The vaccine apartheid must end,
2022/0033,Article,https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/views/battle-for-vaccines-emerging-as-covid-infections-rise-once-again-1658071549,"It may be recalled that millions gathered to celebrate the British Queen's Platinum Jubilee up and down the UK between June 2 and 5, and this gave Covid many opportunities to spread. Subsequently, it was found that an estimated 1.4 million people or one in 45 had caught the virus -- up from one in 65 the week before. That was a rise by 43 per cent. By the week ending June 11, the Covid rates in the United Kingdom had climbed to one in 50 in England-- up from one in 70 the week before; one in 45 in Wales-- up from one in 75; one in 45 in Northern Ireland-- up from one in 65 and one in 30 in Scotland-- up from one in 40. After a period of low case rates, the UK is now seeing increases in Covid outbreaks also within care homes and in hospitals, among those aged 80 and over.

Sensing the growing anxiety, Dr Mary Ramsay from the UK Health Security Agency has observed that it is encouraging that we are not seeing an increase in intensive care unit admissions, but we are monitoring data closely and assessing the possible impact of sub variants BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron which are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. It may be recalled that BA.4 and BA.5 were first identified in South Africa at the start of the year. These new sub variants appear to be spreading more easily partly not only because immunity may be waning, but also because of the genetic mutations which the virus has undergone.

Coronavirus infection in Bangladesh has also suddenly started increasing. In May, the country reported only four Covid-linked deaths and 816 new cases, while 7,356 patients recovered from the disease, according to the DGHS. On June 29  the media reported that the country had registered three more Covid-linked deaths with 2,087 new infections in 24 hours. The new figures took the country's total death toll to 29,145 and the caseload to 1969361, according to the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS).

A week before, the detection rate was below 10 per cent. This evolving scenario meant that the daily-case positivity rate had increased to 15.47 per cent from the two days ago. Health experts have consequently mentioned that there is no alternative way to control this fourth wave of the pandemic in the country without following strict measures.

Consequently, the relevant health authorities in Bangladesh have issued six directives which have to be followed very carefully. These include wearing a mask, avoiding public gatherings as much as possible, and strictly maintaining hygiene rules to contain infection. It has also been suggested that the media, once again, needs to raise awareness among people for maintaining health guidelines. Health experts have also pointed out that people need to undergo Covid-19 test if they see Covid symptoms including fever, cough and cold. Citizens have also been advised to ensure the use of masks at all shopping malls, shops, markets, hotel-restaurants or face legal action. Interestingly, Imams of mosques have also been urged to give sermons for maintaining health guidelines and wearing masks to all during Jumma prayers. The Cabinet Division has subsequently sent a letter to the Secretaries and Divisional Commissioners of all the ministries to implement these directives.

It may be recalled that the largest scientific study on the effectiveness of masks against Covid-19 was conducted in Bangladesh, under the supervision of the Stanford University of the United States. The researchers distributed free surgical and cloth masks to about 340,000 people in 600 villages and explained the proper use and benefits of the masks. The results of this study were published in 2021. Another similar study in Europe was published in the British Medical Journal. Both studies show that if everyone uses the face mask properly, the rate of Covid-19 infection can be reduced by up to 53 per cent. Another study in Bangkok found that proper use of masks when in contact with a person infected with Covid-19 reduces the risk of infection by about 77 per cent.

This evolving scenario regarding the Covid pandemic all over the world has drawn particular attention of international health experts. This has also led, according to UN experts, to a ""Battle for Covid-19 Vaccines between the Rich and the Poor"".

This critical allegation arose recently when  the 164-member World Trade Organisation (WTO) allegedly implicitly rubber-stamped a widely-condemned policy of ""vaccine apartheid"" which discriminates between the world's poorer nations, mostly in Africa and Asia and the developed world. This format is based on wide-ranging intellectual property rights stipulations.

Max Lawson, Co-Chair of the People's Vaccine Alliance and Head of Inequality Policy at Oxfam, pointed this out at the conclusion of the WTO's ministerial meeting in the third week of June with the observation that ""the conduct of rich countries at the WTO has been utterly shameful. The European Union (EU) has also blocked anything that resembles a meaningful intellectual property waiver. The UK and Switzerland have used negotiations to twist the knife and make any text even worse. The US has sat silently in negotiations with red lines designed to limit the impact of any agreement."" He added that ""this is absolutely not the broad intellectual property waiver the world desperately needs to ensure access to vaccines and treatments for everyone, everywhere. The EU, UK, US and Switzerland blocked that text."" He also argued, according to Thalif Deen, the so-called compromise that was reached was largely a format that overrode the rights of developing countries interested in producing COVID-19 vaccines. Lawson warned that ""put simply, it is technocratic fudge aimed at saving reputations, not lives"".

This also led People's Vaccine Alliance to point out that waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines have sparked worldwide debate, from Washington to Beijing and Davos to the World Trade Organisation. The People's Vaccine Alliance also pointed out that in October 2020, South Africa and India proposed a broad waiver of the Trade Related aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) agreement covering COVID-19 vaccines, tests, and treatments. The EU, UK, and Switzerland had blocked that proposal. The US supported an IP waiver for only vaccines. The final text agreed was a watered-down waiver of one small clause of the TRIPS agreement relating to exports of vaccines. It also contained new barriers that are not in the original TRIPS agreement text.

In this context the New York Times has noted that WTO members agreed to loosen intellectual property rights ""to allow developing countries to manufacture patented Covid-19 vaccines under certain circumstances."" The last three words have their own connotation. They make it easier to understand the criticism of Oxfam's Lawson in this regard. He has added, ""South Africa and India have led a 20-month fight for the rights of developing countries to manufacture and access vaccines, tests, and treatments. It is disgraceful that rich countries have prevented the WTO from delivering a meaningful agreement on vaccines and have dodged their responsibility to take action on treatments while people die without them.""

Such criticism has also led some other health experts to observe that it is time for developing countries to be more daring and take bolder action to exercise their rights to override vaccine intellectual property rules. It is being underlined that they should undertake such circumvention to save lives.

Ben Phillips, author of 'How to Fight Inequality' has also commented that rich countries had acted to protect the monopolies of big pharmaceutical companies to determine production levels of pandemic-ending medicines. According to him, such a view was ""causing deaths in developing countries. Almost everyone in every country in the world would be better off if big pharmaceutical companies made slightly less obscene profits so that enough doses of pandemic-ending medicines could be made by multiple producers across the world to reach everyone who needs them on time."" How true! We in Bangladesh have already seen such restrictions having been imposed on us affected production of vaccines.

Mandeep S. Tiwana, Chief Programmes Officer at CIVICUS, a global alliance of civil society organisations (CSOs), has also clearly observed that ""unequal access to vaccines is a global scandal that flies in the face of the economic, social and technological progress we claim to have made as humanity"". In addition he has not only pointed out that CSOs around the world have long called for equity in health care and an end to excessive profiteering by the pharmaceutical industry at the expense of people's well-being but also has drawn attention to the ""need to closely examine the reasons for the lack of political will to meaningfully address these issues.""

In this context one needs to conclude by referring to the statement made last March by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet who observed that more than 10.5 billion vaccine doses have been administered globally, but the ""grim reality"" was that only around 13 per cent of people in low-income countries had been vaccinated, compared with almost 70 per cent in high-income countries.

Is this not a failure to uphold human rights? Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO) has correctly insisted that inaction has risked penalising the planet's most vulnerable people and countries.

All this past week, the news was dominated by societies that seem to be living on separate planets. 

In the US, the CDC issued new guidelines allowing 100 million citizens (roughly 30% of the population that is fully vaccinated against Covid-19) to go without masks in various settings.

Meanwhile, on that very day, India reported over 360,000 new cases, and its cumulative death toll crested past 200,000 for the first time (it is the only the fourth country to get there, after the US, Brazil, and Mexico). But that is only the tip of the iceberg, because public health experts warn of massive undercounting. The actual number of infections and casualties is 20 or 30 times higher.

All across the country, the public record is an agonizing litany of desperation and loss. There’s an acute oxygen shortage, desperate shortfalls of medicine and hospital beds, and nigh-universal breakdown in governance. 

Some cities and states are functioning better: Mumbai and Maharashtra, Kerala’s vaunted primary care systems, some North East states with their vigilant community models. But in most of India, and for the vast majority of its populace, both patients and medical care professionals have been simply abandoned. The human toll is incalculably immense. 

Writing on Twitter account, Virginia Tech political science professor Dr Bikrum Singh Gill commented: “Disconcerting seeing people in the heart of empire -- US, UK, Israel -- celebrate coming [into the] post-vaccination world at [the] very time in which people in Delhi and Gaza are begging for oxygen. All the more so since the two realities are not separate but are fundamentally intertwined.”

Dr. Gill added: “Even critical observers in the West restrict their commentary to this being a failure of the Indian state. Yes, [India] has much to be accountable for, but the real responsibility for this unfolding tragedy lies with [the] US capitalist state and its vaccine imperialism. In its subservience to profit-taking interests of Pharma capital, [the US] first actively worked to destroy the WHO’s global public vaccine initiative. Then, along with other Western states, it rejected efforts by India and South Africa to have patents on vaccines waived at WTO.”

All this is true. When Oxford University announced it was working on Covid-related intellectual property last year, it made the public pledge “to offer non-exclusive, royalty-free licences to support free of charge, at-cost or cost + limited margin supply.” But then the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation engineered an exclusive deal with AstraZeneca, with no price controls. That course change has unfolded a historic global disaster, and with devastating consequences for billions of lives.

It is India’s burgeoning Covid-19 crisis that has most fully exposed the inherent moral and tactical bankruptcies of the Gates Foundation’s fatally botched global plan. 

As accurately summarized by Achal Prabhala and Leena Menghaney in The Guardian, they rely -- entirely absurdly -- on the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) to provide every single Covid-19 vaccine dose for all of the 92 poorest countries in the world, as well as huge numbers of people in the West. At least one-third of all of humanity’s fate was leveraged to rest on this one single fulcrum of production.

Every single one of those poor souls is left hanging in limbo, as SII now “faces the impossible choice of either letting down the other 91 countries depending on it, or offending its own government.” This choice is actually no choice. Every vaccine made in India will stay in India, now and for a long time to come.

Prabhala and Menganey conclude: “This colossal mess was entirely predictable, and could have been avoided at every turn. Oxford should have stuck to its plans of allowing anyone, anywhere, to make its vaccine. AstraZeneca and Covax should have licensed as many manufacturers in as many countries as they could to make enough vaccines for the world [and the] Indian government should have never been effectively put in charge of the wellbeing of every poor country in the world.”

Forty-six-year-old Prabhala is one of the most persuasive voices for international intellectual property reform and access to medicines. From his home in Bangalore, he told me: “I woke up to a headline in the New York Times two days ago which declared that the EU was all set to welcome vaccinated Americans for the summer season. This was at exactly the same time that new infections in India had climbed to 350,000 a day, and deaths had topped 3,000 a day. I felt sick, and outraged. As it is, I can’t watch Indian news -- the news of merely my friends and family getting infected, falling ill, having to be hospitalized -- and worse -- is too much to take.”

Prabhala pointed out that “India is an anomaly. Yes, we’re suffering beyond belief, but we also produce vaccines, and we have a lot of vaccines potentially on hand, which is a situation that absolutely places it apart, [but we have] bungled this exceptional advantage. First, by vastly under-counting our need for vaccines and doing absolutely nothing to invest in a sufficient supply, and then by waiting until we were in the eye of the storm (April, 2021) to finally provide financial commitments for a large quantity of vaccines to the two manufacturers who have vaccines on the market so far.”

What is more, “there’s a global problem we are precipitating by this incompetence,
and as hard as it is to say in the horrible crisis unfolding around us, the Indian government has usurped vaccines that do not belong to the country, and that had been contracted out long before [and] by banning all exports, the Indian government has left about a third of the world’s population out to dry -- with just enough vaccines to cover 1% of their population, if they’re lucky. This is a compounded tragedy.”

I asked Prabhala how to characterize the stark divides we are experiencing, and he told me: “If vaccines are denied to people in the world on the basis of class and nationality, and therefore, effectively by race and ethnicity -- as they are being denied in this moment -- it’s apartheid. It’s hard to describe what’s unfolding now as anything but vaccine apartheid. I guess you could choose your metaphor: At the beginning of this pandemic, we were all supposed to be in the same boat, but that boat turned out to be the Titanic, and we can all see now who’s in first class, and who’s trapped in steerage as the boat sinks.”",https://prod-media-eng.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2021/04/t060141z-1691444123-rc260n90raej-rtrmadp-3-health-coronavirus-vaccine-europe-1-1619724702795.jpg,"April 30th, 2021",Dhaka Tribune,The dystopian dichotomies of vaccine apartheid,
2022/0035,Article,https://www.unicef.org/stories/bangladesh-covid-19-vaccination-rate-has-soared,"When COVID-19 vaccines started to arrive in Bangladesh, people felt a rush of hope. Families and friends could meet again. Life would maybe feel more normal. And it meant schools might reopen.  

For children in Bangladesh, the pandemic has been a crisis like no other, affecting their education, health and well-being. About 37 million children in the country missed out on almost 18 months of in-person learning. It was imperative that vaccines were rolled out quickly and for that to happen, the COVAX vaccine sharing initiative was crucial.  It was a year ago that the first COVID-19 vaccines shared through COVAX landed in Bangladesh. COVAX is a ground-breaking global collaboration led by UNICEF and partners, which is committed to the production and equitable distribution of vaccines across the world.?Since those doses touched down in Bangladesh’s capital, Dhaka, the country has become the largest recipient of COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX. 

At the beginning of June 2021, less than four per cent of Bangladesh’s population had received two doses. One year on, that number now stands at more than 68 per cent. 

That achievement is thanks to the efforts of Bangladesh’s government, health officials and development partners. It’s also been made possible by the enormous sacrifice and dedication of health workers and volunteers.   

Mammoth task to vaccinate over 115 million people with two doses 
Across the country, frontline health workers have been working in urban slums, trekking across fields and navigating rivers to get doses into people’s arms. Thanks to their efforts, over 250 million doses have now been administered, with more than 115 million people receiving two doses of the vaccine. 

Young volunteers like Mohammad Al Mamun have risen to the challenge. He’s been going door to door in Naogaon district in northern Bangladesh, urging people to get vaccinated and helping them register.  In Dhaka, 25-year-old student Mahmuda Nasrin Mukta has been helping to spread the message that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and available.  

“I’ve seen so many vulnerable people. I enjoy going to people’s homes and raising awareness about vaccination. I love helping them,” Mukta says. 

The rise in Bangladesh’s vaccination rate is a big relief to health workers that have been caring for COVID-19 patients in hospitals. 

“When the pandemic started, we didn’t have any clue about the virus. We were definitely scared, but that didn’t stop us from fulfilling our duty,” said Nowrin Jahan, an assistant surgeon at Kurmitola General Hospital in Dhaka. She was one of the first health workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in Bangladesh.  

“Now that the vaccine has arrived, we can work without any fear. The end to our dark days has started,” Jahan said after receiving her jab. Key vaccination target within reach 
Bangladesh has a strong track record of rolling out mass vaccination programmes, especially for diseases like measles and rubella. But getting COVID-19 doses to communities across the country has presented specific challenges.

When COVID-19 vaccines were initially developed and hit the market, wealthy countries bought most of the supplies. That left little for the countries that could not afford them. As a result of this inequity, low priority groups in some countries were getting vaccinated well before high priority and vulnerable groups elsewhere. 

In 2021, between June and August, a devastating third COVID-19 wave hit Bangladesh. Although some COVAX vaccines had started to arrive in the country, it took time to widely distribute the doses.  

“Thanks to UNICEF and strong partnerships, we could finally mobilize COVAX vaccines in substantial quantities in the last quarter of 2021. We supported the government in the expansion of the cold chain and provided support to get the vaccines into people’s arms,” says Dr Merina Adhikari, who is a health specialist and immunization lead at UNICEF Bangladesh.  
To boost the COVID-19 vaccination rate when doses were available, the government launched a mass vaccination campaign to immunize millions of people over the course of several days with the support of UNICEF, WHO and other partners. During the drive, which was held in February 2022, 17 million people were vaccinated.  

The second dose was offered in March as part of that campaign and because of these efforts, the vaccination rate in Bangladesh rose significantly in the first few months of this year.Challenges ahead 
As Bangladesh continues its push to vaccinate millions more people, the country still faces challenges.  

There are still many difficult-to-reach populations, including some older, more vulnerable people. Recent data has shown that about 60 per cent of those aged 60 and over have yet to be vaccinated in Bangladesh, with some citing a lack of information about where and when they can get the vaccine. To reach those individuals and other unvaccinated groups, health workers will need to embark on special vaccination drives in these specific communities.  

Elsewhere, the pressure on Bangladesh’s overstretched healthcare system is intense. In addition to treating COVID-19 patients and helping to vaccinate communities, a lot of health facilities are still trying to cope with the burden of disease that existed before the pandemic.  As we mark one year since the first COVAX doses landed in Bangladesh, the main challenge ahead is to ensure that the COVID-19 vaccines reach every community.  

“UNICEF proudly supports the Bangladesh government’s national vaccination targets, and our focus is on working hand-in-hand with our partners to achieve these goals, leaving no one behind,” reflects Maya Vandenent, who is the chief of health at UNICEF Bangladesh.

Tedros, as he prefers to be called, has labeled the inequity ""vaccine apartheid"" and a ""catastrophic moral failure"" that has led to a ""two-track pandemic.""

Tedros has seen such moral failure before. As Ethiopia's minister of health between 2005 and 2012, he witnessed firsthand how lifesaving HIV drugs were slow to reach infected people in sub-Saharan Africa. To prevent a repeat with COVID-19, WHO and other parties launched the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, a collaboration meant to speed development of medicines and diagnostics to slow the pandemic, and COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility, a global procurement scheme for vaccines. But so far, they have not had much impact.

Science spoke to Tedros on 12 June at WHO's headquarters, which is still largely deserted because of COVID-19, a few hours before he would address the summit of G7 nations underway in the United Kingdom. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

Q: I want to read you something. ""Advocacy, urgency, a sense of optimism that it could be done, and political commitment matched by adequate resources provided the foundation for HIV scale-up."" Do you know who wrote that?

A: We were saying the same thing, many of us.

Q: You've made arguments about unequal access to medicines for years. With COVID-19, the conversation about inequity started before there was something that worked. You were trying to get ahead of it, by doing the advocacy early?

A: When I was minister of health, I saw two global failures. One is HIV. Those who needed [antiretroviral drugs] in low-income countries didn't get it until 10 years after the discovery. That's very, very disappointing. I remember how happy I was when we started the first 900 treatments [in Ethiopia]. Ultimately, the coverage increased. But still, those 10 years were really unacceptable. Not only that, there was an H1N1 influenza pandemic [in 2009]. Vaccines were developed, but they didn't reach low-income countries, especially in Africa.

These are the things I remembered when we were confronted with COVID. And from the start, we were saying: We shouldn't repeat the same mistake. That's why the idea of this accelerator came, and COVAX. It's unprecedented actually to have eight vaccines [authorized] in just a year. But where we're failing is the vaccine equity for distribution.

Q: You're one of the few world leaders speaking about COVID-19 who's had a voice with some anger and frustration, mixed with advocacy. Why do you think so few world leaders are willing to be blunt?

A: I don't think I know the answer.

Q: Has anyone become very ill or even died from COVID-19 who was close to you?

A: Yes. The closest is the stepmother of my wife. And this is before vaccination started, and even now she probably wouldn't have had access. She died. And there are others, a bit more at a distance.

Q: Operation Warp Speed set out with a goal to vaccinate Americans and a target of 300 million doses very early. It wasn't designed to vaccinate the world. It was designed so that President Donald Trump would deliver for the American people and protect the country. What if there had been a different administration that had a more global vision?

A: The problem of just focusing on one country is we will not use the full potential of the whole world.I would turn to the G7 first, and they're here. I would take G20, which controls 80% of the GDP [gross domestic product]. They can influence the whole world. What we have been saying from the start—solidarity, everybody contributes to the basket.

Q: What do you think of the Biden administration?

A: This person has changed everything, turned it upside down. It's day and night what happened. From day one, when Biden reversed the decision [by the Trump administration to defund] the WHO, he has shown his commitment. And the U.S. has made the largest contribution to donating vaccine doses. We appreciate the help and hope other leaders will follow suit and make a significant contribution. We cannot ask the U.S. to do it alone.

Q: You've been talking recently about the idea of a pandemic treaty. What's the essence of that idea, and how would that have affected us today if it existed?

A: One of the challenges we have been facing is sharing. Sharing information, sharing data, and sharing pathogens or biological material. Sharing technology, like what you see now with vaccines. Another problem is global coordination. If we had a treaty, the impact of all these challenges could have been addressed or minimized, especially if it's binding. We need to have a framework that really tells the world, all players, what to do.

Q: Is part of this treaty idea that it would be binding with regard to waivers of intellectual property (IP) for vaccines and other medicines?

A: The IP waiver is one option, and it is key, especially in emergency conditions. Even TRIPS [a World Trade Organization agreement] has a provision to use an IP waiver in emergency conditions. In unprecedented situations, you need to take unprecedented measures. If we're not going to use it now, then when do we use it? Why do we even have it in the first place?

I'm a strong supporter of IP. I'm very grateful to the private sector. And I don't believe in just taking IP away from them. I actually proposed giving incentives, some compensations [in exchange for an IP waiver]. At the same time, the companies also have a social responsibility. This is about the whole world. Who would like the world to be hostage of a virus? Companies can make [a] profit on 99% of their medicines. This is 1% of things.

Q: You tried to launch an IP sharing program called the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool. Are you surprised that no vaccine companies participated?

A: It's a mixed feeling: surprised, not surprised. Social responsibility is just something you would expect from a decent human being when the whole world is burning.

Q: I imagine you have been on the phone with leaders of vaccine companies and you've said what you just said to me to them. Am I right?

A: You're right. I encourage them to help. It's the same response, the same argument: Even if we transfer the technology, there is this problem, multiple owners of the different patents, all that.

Q: COVAX initially had a target of vaccinating 20% of the world population by the end of this year. But the African Union wanted to aim for 60%. What do you think of that?

A: When COVAX says 20%, it doesn't mean that Africa or any individual country can't do more. You can take 20% as COVAX's contribution. And then Africa can use other options. COVAX is the base, the bottom line, and then continents or regions or countries can have their own targets.

Q: You've been criticized for WHO's relationship with China. But there's often little understanding of what kind of power you really have. Because you're representing member states, your hands are always going to be tied at some level. There's only so much you can do with any country to have them open up or be transparent or contribute. I'm curious whether anything could have happened differently with China?

A: Being a member state organization doesn't mean we just do whatever the member states ask us. For instance, the problem between WHO and the former U.S. administration was that we said no to something. No is no because it's not the right thing to do.

Q: What was it that you said no to?

A: I don't think I need to go to that specific detail. But it was something that this organization should not do. And we said, ""No.""

Q: You said no to the Trump administration.

A: Exactly. And that was the problem. Then we were being blamed for not being independent. But if we're saying no to unfair requests and questions, that's independence.

So if you take China, and the origin study, we explained what the challenges are, especially that there wasn't enough cooperation with raw data, especially during the early days, and we pressed them. At the same time, because of the not-well-developed assessment of the lab hypothesis, we said, ""All hypotheses are open."" If there is an issue that WHO should really say straight, we say it.

Q: But you've been heavily criticized for a report that came from WHO, with its imprimatur, saying the lab hypothesis is extremely unlikely.

A: That's where there is a misunderstanding. The group came from different institutions and different countries, and they're independent. There were only two WHO staff who joined them. They came up with their study. At the end of the day, we said: ""OK, there is progress, but there are these challenges."" And we said it openly. We treated China the same way we treat every country.

Q: When SARS-CoV-3 shows up or H17N28 or HIV-3, whatever it is, and you're sitting where you're sitting now, what are you going to do differently on day one?

A: If you're asking for a magic bullet, there's no magic bullet. I appointed a very independent, high-level commission to assess the situation so far and make recommendations. They did a very impartial independent assessment, which we are really proud of. We have to calm down and chart a clear road map on how to respond to the next pandemic. But we have to be very, very serious in learning from this and do things that are as ambitious as possible, and that will be impactful. And I hope the world together will take those recommendations seriously and identify areas that we can address to prevent the next pandemic or to detect it early and manage and minimize the impact.

Q: I want to ask you about your own vaccination. What was the date you got your first shot?

A: May 12.

Q: You're the head of WHO. You could have said in December 2020, ""I'm ready."" Why did you wait?

A: I feel like I know where I belong: in a poor country called Ethiopia, in a poor continent, Africa. With the privileges I have here, maybe I had a chance to have it first. I don't want to use that, because I want to be reminded every day that vaccination should start in Africa. I wanted to wait until Africa and other countries in other regions, low-income countries, started vaccination.

I have a background as a health worker and I'm in one of the risk groups. They were beginning to vaccinate health workers and risk groups [in Africa] around that time, so I thought that was my turn. I was checking my turn, actually, compared to what I would have in Africa, not in Geneva. I was protesting.

Q: Which vaccine did you receive?

A: I didn't even ask. [An assistant] was with me and he had to ask. But I didn't care.

Q: How did it feel once you got vaccinated?

A: I'm still feeling that we're failing. I was having my shot with disappointment.",https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.abk0638/full/Tedros-1280x720.jpg,18 Jun 2021,Science,‘I'm still feeling that we're failing': Exasperated WHO leader speaks out about vaccine inequity,

The year 2020 saw the recurrence of challenges not faced by humanity since 1918. People across the world were preparing to mark the end of World War I in 1918, in which 20 million people lost their lives. Even as the war was ending, the world had to face a pandemic (Spanish Flu) in which 50 million people perished, in two years. The Covid-19 pandemic is perhaps the most difficult medical challenge humanity has faced since then.

But with vastly improved global communications and advances in medical sciences, nations in the 21st Century have faced up to the current pandemic over the past 11 months, with greater confidence than in the past.

The pandemic has resulted in 88 million cases and 1.88 million deaths. Mercifully, the world today is far better placed than it was in 1918, to deal with a global pandemic.

More importantly, the world has learnt to deal with problems affecting the lives of people in a more united manner, because global cooperation is now in place for facing such developments that affect humanity at large.

The Covid-19 pandemic is now at a stage where the largest number of cases and casualties are in some of the most advanced countries. The US has suffered the largest number of fatalities. Even the Europeans have faced extraordinarily high casualties, while the challenges have been met most successfully in East Asia.

The New Year has brought some relief to India in 2021, with Covid recoveries rising. But given the experiences of other countries, we will be hoping that this trend continues, especially as it has been reversed in some parts of the world. Moreover, thanks to some innovative methods adopted, the contraction of India’s GDP in the current financial year has been estimated at a manageable 7.5 per cent.

But what are the trends one can see in the coming years? One can reasonably hope that while there will be ups and downs, there will be enough momentum, to return relatively soon, to the state of the economy that prevailed before the pandemic started.

Growing attention
With the pandemic holding the centrestage, India has become the focus of growing world attention. Strangely enough, the affluent Western world, notably the US and Europe, are focussed almost exclusively on their own problems. There appears to be relatively little interest, or intent, in helping developing countries, which in any case would find American and European products unaffordable.

In a short while, however, India, which is the largest producer of vaccines globally, is the country to which fellow developing countries are turning, to meet their urgent needs. New Delhi has set itself the target of immunising 300 million of its citizens by July, using both AstraZeneca and Bharat Biotech vaccines. While initial commercial exports are scheduled for Bangladesh, Saudi Arabia and Morocco, commitments have also been made for supplies, thereafter, to SAARC neighbours like Maldives, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh Myanmar, Bhutan and Nepal.

This is really an occasion for India to earn the long-term goodwill of its immediate neighbours. One hopes this exercise is carried out imaginatively, for also strengthening our relations with countries across our extended neighbourhood, across the Indian Ocean. We would be well-advised to finance such shipments from our assistance programmes, for cash-strapped neighbours.

With over 22 million cases and 375,000 deaths from the raging coronavirus pandemic in the US, the icoming Biden Administration is going to be predominantly focussed on domestic issues.

This will inevitably provide China the diplomatic space to push its aggressive policies across the Indo-Pacific region. India would be well-advised to make it clear that while it is committed to resolving differences peacefully, its armed forces are prepared to meet cross-border threats.

There are encouraging signs from developments such as the rise in consumer demand that the prospects of an economic recovery and growth are good even now in India. Nomura envisages 9.9 per cent growth in 2021 and a 11.9 per cent growth in FY 22, in India.

Growth rates can be even better if there are positive signs now about the effectiveness of vaccines. Interestingly, a few decades ago, India’s economic growth was dependent on the monsoons, while the growth rates today are dependent on vaccines!

Preoccupied with Covid
The US is now preoccupied with the growing number of its citizens being afflicted with the coronavirus, because of some incredibly clumsy handling of the pandemic by the now disgraced President Donald Trump. The primary focus of the Biden Administration is going to be on internal developments and on repairing the mess that Trump has bequeathed.

We have already seen the impact of Trump’s actions in polarising and dividing American society. Dealing with the coronavirus crisis is going to be the primary focus of attention for Biden. It is going to take years to deal with the challenges the US economy faces. We are going to see the Biden Administration making a concerted effort to repair relations with European allies, which have gone ahead with signing a Free Trade Agreement with China, without any consultations with the Trump Administration. The Europeans, however, appear keen to respond positively to the Biden’s initiative.

In the meantime, China and significant parts of East Asia including Japan, Vietnam and South Korea are set to recover soon from the effects of recent challenges.

While the US could remain the dominant global power, an assertive and economically dynamic China is going to seriously challenge American-led Western dominance. This is evident in the manner the Biden team has moved to build bridges with European powers, which are fed up with the Trump Administration.

The year 2021 will provide ample opportunities for India to consolidate its growing relations with countries across the Pacific and Indian Oceans. We would need imaginative diplomacy to consolidate our relations in the face of challenges, which a growingly assertive China will continue to pose.

It is only appropriate to go ahead with measures we are even now taking to secure both our eastern and western borders with China. Border negotiations with China are going to be challenging. But we must not undermine the successes we achieved in Ladakh last year, without a clear indication that China will pull back to positions they have traditionally held. Moreover, with an imaginative effort, India can, and is likely to play an important role on issues of national security, as it is now a member of the UN Security Council for the next two years.

2022/0038,Meetings Coverage,https://press.un.org/en/2022/ecosoc7069.doc.htm,"Developing countries’ efforts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic are faltering amid ponderous debt burdens, “vaccine apartheid” and yawning chasms of inequality, said the keynote speaker at the Economic and Social Council’s annual Partnerships Forum today, adding that the wealth of a handful of billionaires is growing exponentially as the world continues to scramble.

“As we enter 2022, we are almost halfway to the Sustainable Development Goals deadline, yet COVID-19 is throwing into reverse so much of the progress we had been making,” said Gabriela Bucher, Executive Director of Oxfam International.  Noting that the pandemic created an explosion in inequality which now poses an existential threat to the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, she said that, even before COVID-19, 3.4 billion people were living on less than $5.50 per day while billionaires amassed incredible wealth.  The world’s 10 richest men saw their fortunes double since the pandemic began, while at the same time global poverty rose for the first time in decades.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has turned these cracks and fractures of inequality into chasms,” she said.  Recalling the findings of Oxfam International’s recent report on the state of global inequality, she said the world’s 10 richest men saw their fortunes double since the pandemic began.  Describing “vaccine apartheid” as a clear example of how inequality is killing millions of people, she said rich nations are hoarding vaccines and protecting their pharmaceutical corporation monopolies at a time when less than 3 per cent of people in low-income countries are fully vaccinated.  Demanding that rich nations ensure the fair distribution of vaccine doses, she declared that “extraordinary times call for extraordinary interventions” and called for a solidarity tax on the world’s wealthiest people.

“Instead of gathering dust in billionaire bank accounts, let’s put this money to use, financing the race to meet the Sustainable Development Goals and the radical reduction of inequality,” she stressed.  The vital work of building back better from the pandemic cannot begin until all people have the same foundation.  In that vein, she also called for efforts to address the deeper roots of inequality by asserting worker’s rights to organize, tackling the climate crisis and cancelling the high debts burdens of developing countries.

Collen Vixen Kelapile (Botswana), President of the Economic and Social Council, struck a similar note, declaring:  “Two years into the pandemic, the COVID-19 virus continues to ravage all corners of our world and has reversed decades of development progress.”  In addition, it has laid bare the structural imbalances of the global financial system and their dire impact on developing countries.  “The ones bearing the full brunt of the pandemic are the most vulnerable in our societies — those who are living in extreme poverty, those in the informal sector, persons with disabilities, indigenous people, the elderly, migrants and refugees, people with caring responsibilities and many more.”

While the tools exist to combat those devastating impacts, he said, unequal access to COVID-19 vaccines will continue to slow the global recovery.  At the same time, the world continues to face the three planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, along with a growing number of conflicts which require urgent action.  The 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals must guide recovery efforts by all Governments and a broad range of other actors.  In that regard, he spotlighted the Partnerships Forum as a venue to exchange transformative ideas and make policy recommendations, asking participants to consider such issues as the interconnectivity and cross-cutting nature of the Goals; how to bolster capacity-building for partnership and mutual learning; how to better support vulnerable groups; and how to ensure gender equality, quality education and vaccine equity for all.

Amina Mohammed, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic has added complexity to an already grim landscape in efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, pushing some 100 million more people into poverty and reversing progress on youth education and gender equality.  At the same time, the climate crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, with related shocks forcing 30 million people to flee their homes in 2020 and insufficient commitments threatening an almost 14 per cent increase in global greenhouse?gas emissions over the current decade.

“We must use this year to turn things around,” she said, adding that the concept of global partnership was birthed in times of crises, and is based on the realization that no one country or sector can address global challenges alone.  In his Our Common Agenda plan, the Secretary-General called for boosting partnerships through stronger, more systemic engagement by all actors, including more space for young people, civil society, business, local authorities and others to better inform the United Nations work.  Using the Sustainable Development Goals as a holistic framework, the Partnership Forum can help catalyse a better recovery and a surge in progress in the remaining years before the 2030 Agenda deadline, she said.

Statements

MUNIR AKRAM (Pakistan), speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China, said all efforts to build forward better — driven by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development — must recognize the challenges facing some countries in the face of the pandemic and its deep-felt impact.  Outlining ways to do so, he said access must be granted for vaccines and related health materials, necessary fiscal space for recovery must include easing debt and donors must fulfil official development assistance (ODA) commitments.  In addition, universal access to social protection is critical, as is significant scaled-up investment on infrastructure to, among other things, combat climate change and build resilience.  Additional commitments must be fulfilled to mobilize the requisite $100 billion annually for climate finance.  States in special situations — from landlockedness to least developed status — must be recognized for the unique challenges they face.  Bridging the digital gap is also essential, as is addressing the root causes of development challenges.  Reaffirming that South-South cooperation is a strong concept, he urged the Economic and Social Council to work towards addressing the abovementioned concerns and ensure equitable representation in its membership.

SARAH MCDOWELL (New Zealand) stressed that achieving a green, resilient and inclusive recovery from COVID-19 will require innovative and effective partnerships.  Such partnerships currently underpin her country’s response to natural disasters and the pandemic in the region.  Highlighting that collaborative endeavours are at the heart of the 2030 Agenda, she cited the findings of the Partnership Forum’s global online stakeholder consultation, specifically that health, education, poverty reduction and the participation of women and youth should be priorities for building back better from COVID-19 in 2022, and affirmed that her country will advance those streams of work in a spirit of partnership with Member States, civil society, business, academia, youth and indigenous groups.

MMUSI KGAFELA, Minister for Investment, Trade and Industry of Botswana, said today’s meeting comes at a critical juncture as countries continue to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact while also trying to make progress on the Sustainable Development Goals.  Describing the Partnership Forum as an ideal platform for experience-sharing and peer learning, he described the severe impacts of the pandemic on Botswana’s economy, which is also threatening strides made in poverty eradication.  The Government Economic Recovery and Transformation Plan intends to support recovery, build resilience and introduce life-saving support.  Noting that 72.6 per cent of the population is now fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and many people have also received a booster dose, he went on to outline his country’s efforts to “build back better”, greener and more sustainably.  “Policy choices we make now will profoundly shape the future of our communities and our peoples,” he said, also stressing the need for countries worldwide to coordinate better in such areas as finance and trade.

LYNROSE JANE GANON, Young Women + Leaders for Peace-Philippines, delivering a statement on behalf of the major group children and youth, said young people have not lost sight of the 2030 Agenda even as they battle the current global health crisis.  “The Sustainable Development Goals need to be the foundation for recovery efforts and for rebuilding more resilient communities and institutions,” she stressed, adding that, without a reduction in inequality, violence, injustice and corruption, it will be impossible to make the necessary progress on the 2030 Agenda.  Noting that young people are some of the most affected by the pandemic’s socioeconomic impacts, she said youth nevertheless remain among the most active participants in tackling COVID-19 at the local and national levels, though those efforts largely remain unacknowledged.  Recovery efforts and all decision-making processes therefore need to become more inclusive, especially of young people and women, she stressed.

MILENKO ESTEBAN SKOKNIC TAPIA (Chile) said effective recovery depends on forging strategies that bring together various stakeholders alongside coordinated multilateral action.  Broad, balanced participation in the forthcoming high-level political forum in July is essential, as fruitful partnerships can help to tackle a range of current challenges.  The 2030 Agenda and its targets need effective partnerships to ensure success, he said, outlining Chile’s work towards national progress in various sectors, including establishing the COVID-19 Social Bureau that aims at drawing up recommendations for the Government.  Pointing to recent partnerships with academia and pharmaceutical companies, he said such ventures allowed Chile to access COVID?19 vaccines.  Such innovative partnerships are making meaningful contributions to efforts related to overcoming the pandemic’s varied consequences.

KRZYSZTOF MARIA SZCZERSKI (Poland) said a new policy course must be charted when drafting effective recovery strategies.  Highlighting three suggestions for the Economic and Social Council’s work, he said the principle of leaving no one behind is a starting point, especially considering the pandemic’s impact on human rights and other critical areas.  For its part, Poland has designed social protection responses.  Policy coherence is also needed, keeping in mind that an integrated perspective is required to resolve the pandemic crisis.  The Secretary-General’s Our Common Agenda vision proposed a path centred on solidarity, he said, expressing Poland’s support for it and readiness to take action towards progress.

The representative of Egypt, aligning himself with the Group of 77, recalled that the pandemic has made clear that the task to realize the 2030 Agenda cannot be the task of one Government alone.  Partnerships with other stakeholders, from the private sector to civil society, are critical to, among other things, enhance efficiencies and improve efforts.  Citing national actions, he said Egypt has adapted to the current situation with financing mechanisms in areas from health care to housing.  More broadly, South-South cooperation builds on needs and experience.  Voicing support for strong global partnerships in the quest to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, he said ensuring the active involvement of all stakeholders is critical to realize the 2030 Agenda.

ELENA MARMO, Global Policy Forum, delivering a statement on behalf of the women's major group, said women and girls in all their diversity remain at the forefront of those most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, facing increasing care work, gender gaps, gender-based violence and school drop-outs.  Calling for an urgent reimagining of the global public sector, she said current partnership mechanisms too often favour corporations and private philanthropy.  “These market?driven solutions promoted by market actors have proven inadequate to this task,” she stressed, emphasizing that it is time for Member States to regain their regulatory power over corporations, including those that violate human rights.  Demanding a system that operates in the interests of people and the planet, rather than profit, she pointed out that the failure of the global COVAX Facility demonstrates the need for the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights waiver, with responsibility resting on the global North.

IVAN ŠIMONOVI? (Croatia), aligning himself with the European Union, said that overcoming the pandemic and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals requires consolidation within the United Nations and cooperation with a wide range of partners.  The Council has the capacity to incite stronger cooperation among the Organization’s main bodies and catalyse collective action to address the root causes of instability, reduce inequality within and between States, and to advance the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.  He expressed strong support for the holding of an event on “Structural Measures to Prevent Conflicts and Atrocity Crimes”, emphasizing the importance of the “One Health Approach” to pandemic preparedness, fostering links between the health of humans, animals and the planet, and relying upon cooperation by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health, among others to that end.  He also urged States to strengthen ties between the Council, Governments, local governments and civil society.

LUIS ANTONIO LAM PADILLA (Guatemala), associating himself with the Group of 77 and China and welcoming the current session’s theme, said there can be no doubt as to the need to rebuild economies and foster sustainable development in support of the world’s most vulnerable people.  More international cooperation is needed to promote employment and achieve results in economic growth, while also enhancing social and sustainable development.  Spotlighting the crucial role to be played by South?South and triangular cooperation, he said the pandemic’s effects are undoing progress already achieved in past years.  “We need to pick up the pace and genuinely pool our international and national efforts,” he stressed, adding:  “We need to act now.”

Mr. MESCHANOV (Russian Federation) outlined various national efforts to push towards a more sustainable development model, including the establishment of a National Council on Sustainable Development.  Among other things, the Russian Federation prioritizes such goals as the need to agree internationally on mechanisms for funding sustainability projects in order to avoid “SDG-washing”.  Underlining the need to respect the principles of sovereignty and geographic diversity in all United Nations bodies, he said President Valdimir V. Putin has put forward a range of ideas in the arena of sustainable development, including the creation of a Eurasian Economic Partnership network and the opening of a “Green Corridor” aimed at supplying critical items needed to combat COVID-19 and other crises at the regional level.

The representative of the Basque Government said the pace of progress on the 2030 Agenda is too slow, and requires harnessing the participation of cities, regions and subnational Governments and incorporating them into voluntary national reviews.  Local authorities must be included to ensure success, including by ensuring their equitable representation in various forums, like the Economic and Social Council.  Indeed, local and regional authorities can make a profound impact on realizing the 2030 Agenda and other pressing challenges, he said.

JONIBEK HIKMAT (Tajikistan), associating himself with the Group of 77, said the pandemic is unprecedented in scale and impact, beginning as a health crisis and developing into a force that has now derailed progress on realizing the 2030 Agenda.  To get back on track, revitalized global partnerships remain key.  Focused attention must address bridging gaps, from digital to financial.  For its part, Tajikistan initiated efforts to tackle water-related goals in the 2030 Agenda.  Overcoming these challenges are doable only when partners work together, he said, adding that building such alliances over common concerns can, among other things, overcome mistrust and foster confidence going forward to achieve shared progress.

ALEXANDER MARSCHIK (Austria) aligning himself with the European Union, recalled his experience as the co-facilitator of the high-level political forum’s sustainable development review which concluded in June 2021.  Today’s reinvigorated Partnership Forum, and the Coordination Segment to follow, were among the proposals made last year to bring all key actors together at the start of the Economic and Social Council season, and to ensure that the whole Council system works in unison to prepare for the high-level political forum.  Commending the active engagement of many different groups represented in today’s programme, he expressed hope that it can give impetus for new partnerships to take form during the session this year.  He welcomed that recommendations by stakeholders regarding the thematic focus of the Forum were taken on board and are reflected in dedicated sessions on “Promoting vaccine equity” and “Closing the digital divide”.

GIANFRANCO INCARNATO (Italy), endorsing the European Union’s statement, said reinforcing partnerships, locally and globally, can help define common solutions to build back better.  The role of Member States in the Decade of Action must be complemented by efforts of international financial institutions, the private sector, local authorities, non-governmental organizations, scientific and technological communities and academia.  Explaining that partnerships are at the core of Italy’s development cooperation policy, he urged the international to develop a partnership-oriented approach within and beyond the United Nations and referenced the key role played by global partnerships in the race to develop and distribute COVID-19 vaccines.  Italy facilitated negotiations on the General Assembly’s resolution titled, “Towards Global Partnerships” and is ready to share its best practices in developing and reinforcing partnerships ahead of the high-level political forum.

ALEJANDRA CASTRO, Bayer, delivering a statement on behalf of the business and industry major group, said the Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda continue to guide business action and act as a catalyst in supply- and value-chain relationships across businesses in the global marketplace.  “The private sector has been at the forefront of tackling the pandemic, from the historic race to develop vaccines to repurposing facilities for production of personal protective equipment and vaccination campaigns, to training and educating employees on public health and safety,” she said, also welcoming openness across the United Nations system towards partnering with business in those areas.  However, she voiced concern about evidence of backsliding on sustainable development targets, noting that the global business community stands ready to help get the world back on track sustainably.

NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France), speaking on behalf of the European Union, said setbacks caused by COVID-19 highlight the need for a stronger multilateral system, with the 2030 Agenda offering a road map to achieve a sustainable, inclusive, resilient and just global recovery.  The most urgent matter is to end the global vaccine divide, ensuring equitable access to quality, safe and affordable vaccines throughout the world.  He called on States to support “health multilateralism” and reaffirm the central role of WHO, noting that the European Union — the main donor to COVAX — contributed €3.7 billion in 2020-2021.  Stressing that the multilateral system must address the needs of least developed countries, which are most behind in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, he said sustainable financing should remain a focus of attention in reaching the Goals by 2030.  Recalling that ODA, of which the bloc is the world’s leading provider, was the only stable external financing source during the crisis — and remains crucial for financing sustainable development — he underlined the need for cooperation between the United Nations, multilateral organizations and relevant Group of 20 initiatives, notably the Debt Service Suspension Initiative.

DIEGO PARY RODRÍGUEZ (Bolivia), associating himself with the Group of 77, said the Partnership Forum is mandated to foster the development of innovative partnerships in support of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals.  Noting that global GDP is currently projected to contract by about 4 per cent, he spotlighted vast disparities between developed and developing nations as they struggle to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.  A sustainable recovery that is truly equitable requires stronger partnerships, which he described as a four-pronged enterprise.  First, global access to vaccines must be recognized as a global public good; second, efforts are needed to close the global digital divide; third, better and more sustainable financing is needed for sustainable development; and fourth, multistakeholder partnerships must become more inclusive of all segments of society, especially women and girls.

EMERSON CORAIOLA YINDE KLOSS (Brazil), associating himself with the Group of 77, agreed with other speakers that the COVID-19 pandemic has set the world back in its efforts to achieve sustainable development.  “Partnerships, therefore, are more crucial than ever,” he said, adding that strong partnerships can help bolster the effectiveness, efficiency and productive capacity of the private sector.  Meanwhile, academia and other civil society actors also have a critical role to play in generating synergies that will help the world get back on track, he said.

The representative of University College Dublin, delivering a statement on behalf of the major group for science and technology, said COVID-19 has failed to deliver an effective interface to all nations.  Providing three suggestions to overcome that failure, he said knowledge is not always free to access, and higher education institutions need to be incentivized with a view to reaching institutions in the global South.  Knowledge must also be shared with an increased speed, with universities using such effective mechanisms as digital tools.  Meanwhile, donors and other stakeholders must work towards enhancing science-policy interfacing, he said, adding that existing partnerships can harness the needed tools to make progress on common goals.

MERIEM EL HILALI (Morocco), aligning herself with the Group of 77, said innovative approaches — including online forums — are much appreciated, as they open access to more stakeholders.  Citing several areas that need attention, she said efforts must focus on achieving vaccine equity and bridging the digital divide.  For its part, Morocco has adopted a strategy towards advancing progress on realizing the 2030 Agenda, she said, emphasizing the important role played by multistakeholder partnerships at national and regional levels in this regard.  Morocco, together with the Philippines, aims at making the voluntary national review process a success.

LINQUN LIU (China), associating himself with the Group of 77, said the world is witnessing unprecedented changes including a rapid widening of the development gap.  Stressing that no one country can tackle today’s challenges alone, he called for efforts to usher in a sustainable and equitable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that developing countries have been hit hardest and require international support.  China has already provided some $2 billion in that regard, as well as 2 billion vaccine doses and plans to continue those efforts.  Outlining several national plans to bolster stronger, greener and healthier global development — a plan which is open to all stakeholders — he said China looks forward to engaging with a wide range of actors and injecting new impetus to the joint response to global challenges.

MD MONWAR HOSSAIN (Bangladesh), associating himself with the Group of 77, said the challenges facing effective partnerships and complementarity remain daunting in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The largest test of global partnerships is now the need to provide vaccines for everyone, everywhere.  Stressing that such efforts must not fail, he also called for stronger partnerships in information technology and productive capacity, as well as in tackling the digital divide and harnessing digital technology for the benefit of all.  Emphasizing that a range of public and private partners must work together to achieve those critical goals, he added that civil society, the global financial institutions, national Governments and the United Nations system must also not fail to address the urgent climate crisis.

The representative of the major group for children and youth, said limited civic spaces and attacks on civil society are among the many obstacles young people face in working towards realizing the 2030 Agenda goals and targets.  Youth must be protected and supported, he said, calling on Member States and international groups to protect them and foster effective partnerships.  To do so, it is essential to ensure flexible financial support for youth and to enhance civic space to enable them to work as effective partners towards building back better.

VIDISHA MAITRA (India) stressed that South-South cooperation has become even more crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Noting that her country came to the forefront in the call for joint global action to address COVID-19, she said that India has provided medicines to 150 countries and vaccines to many nations in the developing world.  In India, 75 per cent of adults are now fully vaccinated.  Noting that India’s development partnership approach is designed to release the full potential of developing countries, she stressed that South-South cooperation should not result in undue burden on the recipients, which would make it counterproductive. She highlighted the $150 million India-United Nations Development Partnership Fund, managed by the United Nations Office for South-South Cooperation, which supports South-owned and South-led sustainable development projects focusing on least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States.  The Fund now has a portfolio of 66 projects in 52 countries, including those tailored specifically as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, she said.

TIJJANI MUHAMMAD BANDE (Nigeria) cited several national efforts that aim to advance 2030 Agenda gains in the face of the ongoing pandemic.  However, global steps are needed going forward.  Highlighting several action areas, he said tools and initiatives related to finance would help to address serious concerns for many countries facing crippling debt.  Debt settlement and other options should be part of discussions.  In addition, countries must also compete at the same level with effective tools to work towards development goals.  Recovery efforts should see all nations benefit from equitable vaccine distribution, with all initiatives ensuring access to vaccines for all.  Building back better is a priority for Nigeria, which has adopted a range of measures, including national social investment programmes and initiatives for businesses affected by COVID-19.  Nigeria supports working with partners to ensure that no one is left behind, he said.

JOÃO GIMOLIECA (Angola), noting that the current crisis invoked by the COVID-19 pandemic has overshadowed the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal targets and the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda, cited World Bank estimate that 82 per cent of the new poor will be concentrated in the least developed countries.  He pointed to challenges to his country’s implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals — keeping the economy under control, economic diversification and improving education — among others.  The Angolan Government, through the 2018?2022 National Development Plan, identified priority areas to in relation to the 2030 Agenda and the African Union’s Agenda 2063, with the aim of leaving no one behind and a focus on gender equity.  In the economic arena, Angola faces major challenges to reducing oil dependency, diversifying economically and increasing employment, especially for young people.  There is still a need to extend basic services, in particular access to quality health and education, water supply, energy and sanitation.  In August, the Government will assessment progress in implementing the 2018-2022 National Development Plan.

AHMED DAWOOD ALI AL ZADJALI (Oman), aligning himself with the Group of 77, said his delegation is willing to cooperate with the Council and anticipated a fruitful discussion with a view to finding solutions that can prompt tangible results.  Underlining the importance of meaningful partnerships, he said these efforts can be applied at the local level to speed up the realization of the 2030 Agenda.  The Council can offer a space for dialogue that can lead to progress.  Oman believes that partnerships must be inclusive and has used such an approach in national plans, including enhancing education, utilizing science and technology, and responding to the effects of climate change.  Oman is also working towards enhancing its economic sector by, among other things, working with the private sector and supporting entrepreneurship.

JOYKER NAYECK (Mauritius), endorsing the statement delivered on behalf of the Group of 77, raised several concerns about the current situation with regard to the pandemic’s far-reaching effects.  Highlighting existing inequalities, he said the pandemic has only worsened income gaps and has had a broad impact.  Financial inequalities need to be addressed, and much must be done in other areas, including broadening the availability of vaccines, which is critical to all countries.  Indeed, vaccine access for all is essential, as is reducing financial gaps and providing nations with such options as debt relief.  “We should never again witness vaccine or financial apartheid,” he said, warning that such inequalities would ensure that States would never realize the Sustainable Development Goals.

The representative of Disabled People's International, delivering a statement on behalf of the stakeholder group for persons with disabilities for sustainable development, said the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent policies implemented to deal with it have affected persons with disabilities in grave ways.  Citing research gathered on the experiences of persons with disabilities, he said the most significant barriers — and the priority areas for recommended policy change — include lack of employment and social protection; inaccessible health?care facilities; lack of access to and accessible COVID-19 information and data; lack of accessible infrastructure, transportation, communication and digital tools; decreased security and safety; and a lack of prioritization of vaccines for persons with disabilities.  Calling for efforts to address all those issues, he spotlighted the need to involve persons with disabilities and their representative organizations in the COVID-19 recovery process.

MICHAL MLYNÁR (Slovakia), associating himself with the European Union, said the Economic and Social Council and its subsidiary bodies play a key role in helping countries to implement the 2030 Agenda.  Spotlighting the upcoming meeting on the New Urban Agenda, which is being prepared in conjunction with the Council, he said it will put cities at the centre of global conversations about sustainable development.  In that vein, he spotlighted cities’ disproportionate impact on global gross domestic product (GDP) productivity and greenhouse?gas emissions, stressing that the focus on cities should reach far beyond Sustainable Development Goal 11, as sustainable urbanization stands at the crossroads between a global future of “breakthrough” and one of “breakdown”.

After four days of discussion, Progressive International called for “collective disobedience” to challenge the monopoly of “Big Pharma” enforced through the World Trade Organisation in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic .

“A new international health order is in formation. It is desperately needed to overcome the vaccine apartheid which threatens our very survival, calls the South’s sovereignty into question and risks further murderous mutations of this virus. A concerted effort from states, institutions, companies and peoples is needed to move from nationalism to internationalism, from competition to cooperation, from charity to solidarity,” said Varsha Gandikotla-Nellutla, Cabinet member of the organisation, in a statement.

Progressive International has called for open collaboration of COVID-19 vaccine technologies, solidarity prices for vaccines, pooling of the manufacturing capacity to ramp up vaccine and medical equipment production.

The organisation will hold more such international meets for ‘create an alternative strategy for vaccine internationalism including states, political actors and manufacturers’.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/national/bdjm83/article34886667.ece/alternates/FREE_1200/image-5,"June 21, 2021",The Hindu,"Coronavirus | End ‘vaccine apartheid’: civil society movements’ coalition
",
2022/0040,Article,https://hphr.org/iqbal-blog-3/,"The U.S. has vaccinated more than 50% of the population, while Sub-Saharan Africa has only administered eight doses per 1,000 people. Numerous developing countries have criticized the distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine as “vaccine apartheid.”

 

Rich countries have brought more vaccines than they need. The European Union could vaccinate its citizens twice. Britain and the United States could do so four times, and Canada six times over, while only 0.3% of doses have been administered in low-income countries. 

The European Union and more than two dozen wealthy nations have collectively purchased 6 billion doses through 2023 to vaccinate its citizens against new variants of the virus. The rest of the world has purchased only 3 billion doses of the vaccines. 

 

Wealthy nations in the Global North, representing only 13% of the world’s population, have already cornered more than half (61%) of the promised doses of leading COVID-19 vaccines, despite developing countries being more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic due to lack of medical and economic infrastructure. The lack of collaboration in vaccine distribution among nations has resulted in prolonged health consequences, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. 

 

Covid-19 does not discriminate based on borders, skin color, or socio-economic status—treating the pandemic as an isolated event and expecting a quick recovery would be reckless. We live in a global economy, and no country is exempt from the pandemic’s consequences until all countries achieve herd immunity. If vaccination campaigns do not reach the developing world, it will cost the global economy U.S. $9 trillion. Covid-19 has already pushed 230 million in India into poverty and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands. After initially getting Covid-19 under control, Taiwan is experiencing a second wave surge in the number of cases leading to curbing gathering and shutting down recreation venues. A doctors group in Japan is urging the Prime Minister to cancel the Summer Olympic games. 

 

To fight this pandemic, we need to remove intellectual property patents for all COVID-19 vaccines. U.S. President Joe Biden has decided to waive the patent protection for the American-made COVID-19 vaccines. However, the E.U. doesn’t support the policy, stating that developing countries may not maintain high-quality standards of vaccine production despite AstraZeneca manufactured in Pune, India. 

Both World Health Organization (WHO) and Doctors Without Borders support waiving patents to provide access to life-saving drugs to millions. The World Trade Organization (WTO) operates by consensus from member states, so the United States and developing countries cannot alter the global landscape. The issue at WTO will probably take months to resolve, and millions will die as a result. Patents for the Covid vaccine should have been removed from the onset of the vaccination drive. 

 

The developed countries also need to export extra vaccines they have bought. While the U.S. has decided to donate 500 million vaccine doses to the developing countries, with 200 million to be shared this year and the remaining 300 in the first half of 2022, we may need 11 billion doses to vaccinate the world. While this a step in the right direction, it is not enough; other developed countries also need to do more; otherwise, developing nations may not start widespread vaccination well past 2023. 

 

Millions of lives will be lost, while the economy may never reach the pre-pandemic level for many countries. If the virus is not brought under control, it will destabilize the livelihoods of millions of poor people in developing countries. According to Matteo Chinazzi of Northeastern University, if the first two billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines were distributed proportionally by the national population, worldwide deaths would fall by 61%. AstraZeneca has pledged to sell on a not-for-profit basis in developing countries to close the accessibility gap, but it can provide vaccines to only 18% of the population in developing countries due to logistical and financial constraints. At the same time, the entirety of Moderna’s supply and 90% of Pfizer’s supply has been secured by wealthy nations. 

Most vaccines are always made with the help of public institutions or public finance. Moderna’s work rests on the discoveries made by the University of Pennsylvania, and the pharmaceutical company received federal funding of $US2.5 billion from the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed program. Pfizer did not receive any money from the U.S. government but received $440 from the German government. 

 

Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech’s successful mRNA vaccines are set to become two of the world’s three best-selling pharmaceutical products. The companies are projecting revenues of $33.5 billion in 2021 from their vaccines, despite a study from the Imperial College in London showing that the cost of producing new mRNA vaccines could be between 60 cents to $2 per dose. The United States is paying $19.50 for each dose, while Israel is paying $30 per dose. Since these vaccines are made from taxpayer’s money, it is only fair that we treat them as a public good and remove all the barriers to access. 

 

In the 1970s, WHO played the role of coordinator to eliminate smallpox. Countries like Bangladesh, Malaysia, Kenya went from minimal production to donating state-of-the-art vaccines back to the WHO to give it to other countries within a few years. They need to do the same now. During World War II, the U.S. government, when trying to make more antibiotics, specifically penicillin, made Pfizer give up its formula and shared it with Pfizer’s competitors and gave contracts to other manufacturers, which were all done by the War Production Board, which got a special dispensation to suspend antitrust law.

 

The world is amid a once-a-century pandemic, and it is morally wrong to stop vaccines from reaching people that do not have the money to pay for them. All the patents need to be revoked, and wealthy countries should donate all the excess stock they have—that is the only way to stop this pandemic. No one is safe until everyone is safe.

2022/0041,Article,https://wordpress.bruegel.org/2021/04/vaccine-diplomacy-soft-power-lessons-from-china-and-russia/,"As COVID-19 continues to rage throughout Europe, China and Russia seem to be giving the European Union lessons in soft power on its home ground. Several EU members and countries nearby are turning to Beijing and Moscow for additional supplies of COVID-19 vaccines, faced with discontent at the slowness of the EU’s own vaccination rollout, supply shortages, delivery bottlenecks, poor communication and concerns about vaccine safety.

China’s vaccine deliveries come with soft-power messages. Beijing is providing its vaccine free to Chinese citizens and to 53 countries while, in parallel, seeking to counter critical views, following harsh Chinese repression in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, by vaunting its economic success, scientific and medical achievements, culture and language. Beijing is completing Europe’s largest Confucius Institute in Serbia, an early recipient of Chinese vaccines. The institute is located on the site in Belgrade where the Chinese embassy once stood before being bombed by NATO in 1999.

Heavy symbolism

Meanwhile, Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine is gaining increasing acceptance in Europe. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is reviewing its efficacy and it has won plaudits from the head of Germany’s standing commission on vaccination. Germany’s health minister has discussed overcoming supply shortages in the EU with Chinese and Russian vaccines, once they have been approved. Bavarian Prime Minister Markus Söder has announced a preliminary purchase order for 2.5 million doses of Sputnik V, to be produced in Bavaria. Chancellor Merkel said in March there were “good data” on Sputnik V and that all vaccines were welcome once they receive the green light.

Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have discussed joint production of Sputnik V with Russian President Vladimir Putin. This is despite heightened tensions with Moscow following the imprisonment of opposition leader Alexey Navalny and Russia’s recent troop build-up near Ukraine.

Russia misses no chance to accompany offers of vaccine or joint production to Eastern Europe and the Balkans with soft-power messages, dwelling on European failures and highlighting Russian support for countries covered by the EU’s enlargement and neighbourhood policies. Over fifty countries have ordered the Sputnik V vaccine. Russia has made a show of vaccine deliveries to Serbia and Montenegro, while Croatia has begun talks with Russia about acquiring the Sputnik V vaccine. Croatia’s health minister is reported to have asked its health regulator to authorise the vaccine without waiting for EMA approval.

The Czech Republic and Slovakia have also turned to Russia for supplies of Sputnik V. But Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic resigned in March after failing to obtain the governing coalition’s agreement for his personal decision to purchase 2 million doses of the Russian vaccine. Hungary became the first European country to administer Sputnik V in February 2021, after issuing emergency authorization, and plans are afoot to produce the vaccine in Italy. Austria has held talks with Moscow about acquiring the Russian vaccine once it has been evaluated by EMA. Austria’s Chancellor Sebastian Kurz accused EMA of being too slow to approve the vaccine.

Beijing meanwhile is targeting low and medium-income countries for early vaccine deliveries. It has supplied vaccines to EU member Hungary and EU candidate countries Serbia and Turkey. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban posted a photo of himself being inoculated with a vaccine from Chinese manufacturer Sinopharm. China had shipped 115 million doses worldwide while the EU had exported 58 million by the end of March. Recently, however, concerns have grown about the relatively low protection rates given by Chinese vaccines and about their availability. Trust in the reliability of Russian data and the comparability of its tests is still wavering.

EU countries are entitled to acquire vaccines approved by their regulatory authorities from suppliers not involved in the EU’s centralised scheme. But a senior EMA official condemned this as “somewhat comparable to Russian roulette,” a remark that prompted calls for an apology from the Sputnik V manufacturer and criticism from the Kremlin.

Alarmed at member countries breaking ranks, European Council President Charles Michel launched a fierce defence of the EU’s response to COVID-19. He wrote in his newsletter: “We should not let ourselves be misled by China and Russia, both regimes with less desirable values than ours, as they organise highly limited but widely publicised operations to supply vaccines to others.”

A geopolitical open door

Nonetheless, the late rollout of the EU’s vaccine purchase and delivery scheme handed Beijing and Moscow a commercial and diplomatic opportunity that fitted their strategic narratives. For China, supplying vaccines to Europe forms part of its ‘Health Silk Road’, a rhetorical extension of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), intended to showcase the prowess of China’s medical sciences and its devotion to global public goods. China promotes the BRI in Central and Eastern Europe through 17+1, a loose network launched in Warsaw in 2012. At the start of the epidemic, China and Russia stepped in to provide masks and personal protective equipment to European countries amid severe supply shortages.

Moscow, too, seeks to convey the impression that its medical science is prevailing over the West’s, despite low vaccination rates in Russia itself. The name Sputnik V mirrors that of the world’s first artificial satellite, launched by the Soviet Union in 1957. Russia rushed to become, on 11 August 2020, the first country whose COVID-19 vaccine was approved by national authorities.

China and Russia are pushing at an open door in Eastern Europe because of the EU’s faltering strategies in the Balkans and eastern partnership countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine). The EU promised membership to Balkan countries at the Thessaloniki summit in 2003. Since then, only Croatia has joined the EU, and there are scant prospects for others to follow in the foreseeable future. Persistent governance problems in the Balkans and enlargement fatigue in the EU are responsible for the stalemate.

Despite repeated assertions that the region is destined for EU membership, the EU lacks a credible geopolitical strategy for the Balkans, an area surrounded by EU members that are its major donors and investors. The EU has provided €70 million from existing funds to Balkan countries to acquire vaccines and a €3.3 billion package to tackle the health crisis, support investment and stimulate recovery. Balkan and eastern partnership countries are eligible for vaccines under the World Health Organisation’s global COVAX scheme for low- and medium-income countries. The EU recently doubled its contribution to COVAX to €1 billion. But these efforts fall far short of neighbouring countries’ needs and of the COVID-fighting programmes deployed within the EU itself. In March 2021, the European Commission ended the exemption of Balkan countries from the EU’s vaccine export controls, reducing the credibility of its soft-power outreach to the region.

Foreign ministers from nine EU countries on 11 March 2021 called on the Union “to take a strategic look at the Western Balkans.” They asserted that the pandemic had exacerbated existing trends, with their geopolitical implications, and that “other actors are ready to step into regional affairs, often at our expense.” Despite huge EU support for the region, “other actors were more effective in presenting their support and thus undermining our reliability, credibility and perception of our solidarity.” Earlier, in January 2021, a group of foreign ministers, mainly from the EU’s new member states, made a similar plea on behalf of Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Vaccine diplomacy and soft power

But despite the diplomatic and commercial agility with which China and Russia have moved to fill the vaccine and geopolitical gaps to the EU’s east and south-east, their soft-power appeal to the countries concerned is limited.

Soft power derives from the attractiveness of a political, economic and social model and whether others aspire to emulate it. Despite China’s success in containing the pandemic domestically and the early availability of its vaccines, few in Europe and its eastern periphery seek to emulate the Chinese model of society. Russia, too, holds little appeal to populations in Europe’s east whose main preoccupations are unemployment, living and governance standards and, in some cases, corruption. Disinformation, domestic repression and cyber-attacks do little to endear the Chinese and Russian regimes to public opinion in Europe.

Some 59% of respondents across the Balkans to the June 2020 Balkan Barometer survey consider that EU membership would be a good thing, up from 42% in 2014, the baseline year. The benefits of EU membership cited most often are greater prosperity and freedom to travel for work and study. Serbia, where state television regularly presents the EU in a negative light while depicting China and Russia positively, is an outlier, with less than a third favouring EU membership. However, there is growing pessimism in the region about the prospects for joining the EU.

In Eastern Partnership countries, where the most recent regional survey was conducted in 2019 before the pandemic, just over half the respondents had a favourable view of the EU; 80% associated it with economic prosperity and human rights. Setbacks in fighting the pandemic have dented but not destroyed the EU’s soft power in the Balkans and Eastern Europe.

Strategic choices

Chinese companies are engaged in public works in European countries, especially in Serbia. But infrastructure projects promoted by China’s BRI have provoked environmental protests, created few jobs for local workers and raised debt levels to unsustainable levels, particularly in Montenegro. Some major projects have been cancelled or remain incomplete. Six EU countries that are part of the 17+1 initiative were represented only by lower-rank officials at a virtual summit hosted by President Xi Jinping in February 2021, a setback that may herald the demise of this tenuous grouping.

If some governments in the Balkans and Eastern Europe appear to be prioritising vaccines from China and Russia, it is less on geopolitical grounds than as a response to delays in delivery by western suppliers. President Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia and Prime Minister Orban in Hungary exemplify this opportunistic, tactical approach. Mr. Vucic takes pride in achieving a high vaccination rate by using European, Chinese and Russian vaccines, claiming that he remains equidistant from all three. He has announced an agreement to produce Sinopharm vaccines in Serbia.

Chinese and Russian vaccine diplomacy might offer a partial workaround in the face of EU delays, but not a strategic choice. The aspirations of strengthening democracy and closer EU links remain strong in the Balkans and in Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Sabre-rattling by Moscow over Ukraine and the ongoing Russian absorption of Belarus will reinforce the tilts to the west of EU partner countries.

The EU should reinforce its position in the region with more inclusive policies, clearer signalling and robust measures to counter disinformation. Vaccine deliveries through COVAX should be accelerated and supplemented by additional donations from EU countries, as their own vaccine rollouts gather pace. The Western Balkans should be exempted from the EU’s vaccine export control mechanism.

At the same time, EU representatives should push back firmly when Serbian President Vucic conveys the misleading impression that the Balkans can rely as much on China and Russia as on the EU, or when he poses as a regional benefactor, making small well-publicised donations of European-supplied vaccines to North Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. The population should be reminded that the EU has done far more than China or Russia to modernise the Balkans’ healthcare sector, providing over €450 million in grants and loans during the past twenty years to Serbia alone. Unstinting support in fighting the pandemic is the most tangible way for the EU to demonstrate its commitment to the wellbeing of neighbouring countries, which look to Brussels for solidarity.",,"April 27, 2021",bruegel,Vaccine diplomacy: soft power lessons from China and Russia?,

The report titled ‘Center for Genocide Studies Peace Report, an initiative of Bangladesh Peace Observatory’, by Center for Genocide Studies suggested was published on August 10. 

Professor of International Relations and Director of Centre for Genocide Studies at University of Dhaka Imtiaz Ahmed told Dhaka Tribune the government should go for coproduction to secure the supply of vaccines to inoculate as many people as possible. 

In his editorial in the report, he noted “...it remains a puzzle as to why the Serum Institute of India could not supply the much-required 1.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines to Bangladesh in the last three months to cover those who had only one shot and needed the second jab, which would have been only 500,000 doses per month.”

He also pointed out that some people are concerned about the efficacy of the Chinese vaccines and that is irrational. 

“It stemmed from the colonial mindset I assume. Many people in this part of the world tend to believe that anything coming from the West is better than everything else,” he told the correspondent.

In his article ‘Covid-19 Vaccine Diplomacy: A New Foreign Policy Imperative,’ former foreign secretary Shahidul Haque said that Covid-19 vaccine production and distribution is likely to have impacts not only on the market and health but also on the geopolitical order, particularly in Asia.

The Covid-19 vaccine is more of a “geopolitical good” rather than a “public good”, he said in his paper. Meanwhile, Lailufar Yasmin, professor of the Department of International Relations at Dhaka University focuses on vaccine nationalism in her paper. 

She told Dhaka Tribune that the vaccine hoarding for Western citizens and for its further use as booster doses, as this might be repeatedly needed like the flu shots, have created a new type of colonialism, that is vaccine colonialism. 

“The world is but one community irrespective of where we live because of complex interdependence, especially when it comes to diseases and environmental issues. Under these circumstances, I find that the Western countries have little moral authority to talk about human rights issues when they themselves are only concerned about ensuring protection for their own citizens and creating divisions among people,” she said. 

This will prolong the crisis, which today or tomorrow will affect Western countries as well, she told the correspondent. 

A report by anti-poverty campaigners found that rich countries have over a billion more doses of Covid-19 vaccines than they need, leaving poorer nations scrambling for leftover supplies as the world seeks to curb the coronavirus pandemic, reports Reuters. 

The Center for Genocide Studies report recommended that for the lower-income community immunisation from Covid-19, the health authorities are required to deploy field level health workers to raise awareness among the community about the importance of vaccination in Bangladesh. 

The report pointed out that the motives behind the lack of interest in taking the vaccine were registration dilemma, fear and suspicion, information and communication gap, lack of mass outreach, absence of lower income community, and age restriction.

2022/0043,News,https://www.dawn.com/news/1648588,"Get vaccinated! Every leader agrees that without equal access to vaccines, a world without Covid-19 is not possible. So much so that South Korean superstar band BTS advocated for vaccinations at the United Nations last week amid surges of coronavirus in different parts of the world.

If only pretty boy bands had the power to sway world leaders towards vaccine equality.

But outside the gilded stages, the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) global target of 70 per cent of the population vaccinated by mid-2022 is not possible since poor countries do not have sufficient access.

While research suggests that enough vaccines will be produced this year to ensure WHO’s target is met, they are reserved for the wealthy countries who are moving on to booster shots for those who are already vaccinated. Countries manufacturing vaccines are restricting exports of doses so that they can get vaccinated first in a form of ‘vaccine nationalism’.As a result, just about 3pc of people in low-income countries have been vaccinated with at least one dose, compared to over 60pc in high-income countries.

While patents protect and promote research, the debate of whether vaccine technologies should be transferred raged on. “Bangladesh is ready to produce vaccines at a mass scale if technical know-how is shared with us and patent waiver is granted,” said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh.

The average cost of a Covid-19 vaccine ranges from $2 to $37, given that there are 24 vaccines that have been approved by at least one national regulatory authority.

""The foreign ministers agreed that vaccines, as a key weapon to defeat Covid-19, should be distributed following the principle of equity and justice,"" said foreign ministers of China, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh in a joint statement today, a day after a video conferenceThe foreign ministers expressed that ""vaccine nationalism"" will hinder the global efforts to defeat Covid-19, and strengthening cooperation to track virus mutation closely. They stressed that countries should step up solidarity and cooperation to win the final victory over the virus.

They expressed firm support to WHO's due role in the global cooperation against Covid-19 and acknowledged that tracing the origin of the virus is a matter of science and a global mission.China expressed its readiness to provide continued medical supplies and technical assistance to participating countries of the conference to the best of its ability.

At the event, the foreign ministers agreed to closely follow developments of the Covid-19 situation in India. They expressed willingness to provide needed support through respective channels in consultation with India.

Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Afghanistan's Acting Foreign Minister Mirwais Nab, Bangladesh's Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen, Nepal's Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi, and Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena held the conference under a new platform led by China.

The initiative was taken first in November last year, and subsequent meetings were held at director-general, foreign secretary, and then foreign minister levels. In a spirit of openness, inclusiveness, and win-win cooperation, the six countries welcomed the active participation of other countries in the region.

2022/0045,News,https://qz.com/2139368/lithuania-cancelled-its-vaccine-donation-to-bangladesh/,"Covid-19 vaccines have been a tool of diplomacy since they were developed, shaping and strengthening allegiances between countries, as well as creating rifts. One of the tensions that might have precipitated the situation between Russia and Ukraine, for instance, was Ukraine’s refusal to accept the Russia-made vaccine Sputnik as sufficient protection against the virus.

Now, with the world taking sides in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, vaccine access is being used to retaliate against countries that aren’t expressing full opposition to Russia’s actions. This is what happened in the case of Lithuania, which decided to cancel its donation of nearly half a million Pfizer covid-19 vaccine doses to Bangladesh, after Bangladesh abstained in the UN General Assembly’s vote condemning the invasion.

Another form of sanctions
Lithuania had decided to send the donation only last week, but backtracked once Bangladesh joined the 35 countries that abstained from voting on the UN resolution against Russia (while Eritrea, Syria, North Korea, Belarus, and of course Russia itself, were the only countries to vote against it).

So far, about half the Bangladeshi population (a total of 165 million people) has received a full initial course of a covid-19 vaccine, whether from a western manufacturer (Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson) or a Chinese one (Sinopharm and CoronaVac).

Lithuania’s move, announced by Rasa Jakilaitien?, a representative of the country’s prime minister, amounts to a sanction of sorts—and like many sanctions, it ends up harming the civil population far more than the government it is meant to target.

The many facets of vaccine inequity
While some have celebrated Lithuania’s decision as a means of holding Bangladesh accountable for its actions (or lack thereof, as this was an abstention), others have noted that withholding a vaccine from a vulnerable population isn’t an action to praise. “I do not celebrate the cancellation of life saving vaccines to people,” tweeted Alexandra Phelan, an assistant professor at the Center for Global Health Science & Security at Georgetown University.

The action also highlights the less obvious vulnerabilities created by vaccine equity. Indeed, Bangladesh wouldn’t have found itself in the position of depending on vaccine donations had the doses been distributed more fairly.

The United Nations hasn’t expressed an official position on the issue. Officials in Lithuania and Bangladesh didn’t respond to Quartz’s request for comment.

2022/0046,Article,https://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/blog/vaccine-diplomacy-new-chapter-story-soft-power,"The experts are agreed: the efforts by so many states to produce and distribute in the world their own, national, anti-COVID vaccines have set in motion a new form of geopolitical and soft power competition. A headline in Foreign Affairs proclaimed: ""Beijing Hasn’t Won the Soft-Power Stakes But It Has An Early Lead."" As recently as February 13, the U.S. government was accused by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) of just ""looking on."" If this picture was ever true, it has now radically changed as we shall see.

By way of contrast, said the WSJ reporting from Ethiopia, in the week of February 21 alone, a million Chinese government-backed doses passed through Addis Ababa airport, destined for Ethiopia and surrounding nations. At least 69 countries have now received such doses in the Middle East, Europe, Latin America, even Oceania. 

All this was regardless of China’s own population, where observers calculate that only 3.65% of citizens had been vaccinated by the end of February according to la Repubblica. In an article for The Financial Times (FT) titled, ""The west should pay attention to Russia and China’s vaccine diplomacy,"" Moritz Rudolf of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs said, “Health was one of the many subtopics of the Belt and Road initiative. With the pandemic, it has become the main focus."" 

No one doubts that Russia, with its Sputnik V, sees in its vaccine a new weapon—the first for many years—in its eternal struggle with the West, and in projecting influence more widely. The FT went on to note its clients had requested 1.2 billion doses by the end of February. Italy—where a new Sputnik factory is allegedly to be built—Iran and Hungary have provided Russia with unmistakable propaganda successes on this front and helped conceal the disinformation efforts aimed at discrediting Western products, which has been denounced by the U.S. State Department. Sputnik is forecast to be used across Latin America, and in places as different as Belarus, Algeria and Nigeria. At home, meanwhile a mere 4.57% of the population had been vaccinated by the end of February. 

So many and so persistent have been the comments that link vaccine diplomacy to 'soft power' that it’s become worthwhile to reflect on whether that formula itself might now need some re-thinking.
But it’s central Europe and the Balkans that are considered the most attractive prizes by those who see all this as a competition in soft power. Slovakia and Croatia are both looking to Russia and China in the absence of an adequate European presence there. In Serbia, President Vu?i? has been able to offer his citizens a choice of European, Russian and Chinese products, thereby maintaining his geopolitical distance from each of these poles. The first abovementioned WSJ article reported that on January 16, 1 million Chinese doses arrived in Belgrade, with 200,000 arriving from Russia on the 20th.

But both these players know that they have another great rival in this game: India, home of one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical industries. On January 20, India pledged to distribute its version of the AstraZeneca vaccine to its neighbors Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. This is characterized as a public diplomacy initiative called, ""Friendship Through Vaccines."" While China and India go through another of their armed confrontations on the latter’s northeastern frontier, Aung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar—before the coup—deliberately chose the Indian vaccine for her country, in order not to feel bound to Beijing. Pakistan has no such hesitations and has openly embraced the Chinese product according to an article in Asia Times titled, ""How some countries are using Covid to enhance soft power.""

What seems certain by now is that the great medical, political and propaganda efforts deployed by the big three powers examined here serve in practice the purpose of distracting the world from their failures or disasters on numerous other issues covered by the soft power formula, from human rights to the anti-poverty battle, from the inadequacies of their own health systems to the ambiguities of their ‘aid’ programs in various parts of the less developed world. An Indian political scientist said as much explicitly in an article for Foreign Policy: the Modi government, he suggested, has probably calculated that a net decline in India’s soft power for now would be a price worth paying for the consolidation of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party control at home, and for the fulfillment of its long-term, radical, political project.

So many and so persistent have been the comments that link vaccine diplomacy to 'soft power' that it’s become worthwhile to reflect on whether that formula itself might now need some re-thinking. Obviously there are very few states that can match the high-minded, moralistic standards that Joseph S. Nye laid down originally for the normative definition of his conception, if not for brief moments. The COVID drama—and the response of certain great powers—may of course be one of these moments. But if detached from all the other political activities of these nation-states, at home and abroad, the gain in prestige they may currently enjoy—and 'prestige' is simply the historical antecedent of 'soft power'—risks being entirely ephemeral. 

If instead we consider 'soft power' under another light, as a mechanism for connecting power in the traditional sense (military, economic, geopolitical) and influence, then another perspective emerges. Contemporary history, and the 'American Century' in particular, demonstrates that the most effective, enduring and penetrating of the links that have connected power and influence arise from the models of modernity—of change, innovation, even 'progress'—which a society is capable of producing and distributing in the world.

Clearly those private Western corporations and universities that have produced in record time the first anti-COVID vaccines have in this sense bestowed on their host nations a soft power premium. But with one condition: that those countries, through their governments, must fill a Nye-style moral requirement and ensure that the benefits of their scientific progress are felt by as many of the world’s citizens as their own. In its own ambiguous way, China, Russia and India have each taken on this challenge, particularly the PRC, which uses the most elevated language to explain its purposes. The others, via the COVAX project, know perfectly well that it exists and have started to move, with the U.S. joining a pre-existing alliance of Japan, India and Australia to counter the Chinese crusade. The EU is awakening to the exposure of its Balkan flank.

2022/0047,Article,https://theconversation.com/vaccine-diplomacy-how-some-countries-are-using-covid-to-enhance-their-soft-power-155697,"The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to various new, repurposed or newly popular terms. The newest entry to the pandemic lexicon might be “vaccine diplomacy”, with some countries using their jabs to strengthen regional ties and enhance their own power and global status.

In early February, half a million doses of the Chinese Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Pakistan, before soon also reaching 13 other countries including Cambodia, Nepal, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe. The Chinese ambassador to Pakistan declared it a “manifestation of our brotherhood”, a sentiment echoed by the Pakistani government. Russia has similarly used its own Sputnik V vaccine to win friends and support, providing access to countries as yet unable to start their own vaccination programmes.

India has been donating supplies of the AstraZeneca/Oxford jabs produced in the country to regional neighbours including Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal, bolstering not only its reputation as a supplier of cheap and accessible vaccines to the global south, but also challenging China’s efforts at regional dominance at a time of heightened tensions between the two countries.

Meanwhile, Israel has reportedly agreed to pay Russia to send the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine to the Syrian government as part of a prisoner exchange deal.

Vaccine diplomacy has also involved efforts to undermine trust in the intentions and efficacy of rival powers. China and Russia have both been accused by governments in Europe and North America of state-backed disinformation campaigns seeking to undermine trust in vaccines produced in those regions. And Russia sent supplies of Sputnik V to Hungary, in a move seen by some as designed to undermine EU unity and credibility.

Europe and North America have been late to the game in providing vaccines to poorer countries and regions. Calls from leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron to donate vaccines to poorer countries, and pledges from the UK to donate surplus supplies have only emerged in recent days.The prospect of global health becoming a new arena for global power competition and rivalry should worry us all. Whatever benefits may have emerged from such rivalries in the past, they did so through cooperative rivalry. The global response to COVID-19 has thus far tended to be uncooperative and divisive, casting blame or seeking to spread distrust.

The complexities of global health, and the needs of the billions excluded from the benefits of vaccine science and innovation, demand a truly global response. Whether responding to COVID-19 will lead to a more equal partnership for health for all, or reinforce some of the worst instincts displayed during the past year, will determine not only the course of COVID-19, but the impact of the next epidemic to threaten global health, and the ones that follow that.

Strings attached?
In the absence of providing vaccine supplies to poorer countries, some in the west sought to cast doubt on the credibility of Chinese and Russian efforts, presenting them as cynical ploys for diplomatic advantage. You may be getting vaccines, they have been telling the world, but at what cost in your obligations to Russia and China – even as western countries wrap their own international aid in conditions, often involving aspirations for trade deals.

The response to the virus has been embedded in global power and diplomatic wrangles from the very start – from the Trump administration referring to “the Chinese virus” at every turn as part of its wider political and economic struggles with China, to Chinese efforts to use its own success to enhance the legitimacy of strict measures and curbs on political and social freedoms.

Fighting disease has in fact long been used as a means for extending soft power and winning friends. Superpower rivalries for influence through the needle have sometimes even been positive: the success of the smallpox eradication campaign was in part fuelled by the rivalry between the Soviet Union and US. Responding to the Sars epidemic in 2002, China provided assistance and support to affected countries to bolster its global power status, including to Taiwan. This stands in stark contrast to its more tense relationship with Taiwan in this latest epidemic.

Such assistance has tended to accrue the most soft-power influence when aid has been seen as impartial and free from naked self-interest. Before being merged with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, for example, the reputation of the UK’s former Department for International Development (DfID) was in part enhanced by its legally enshrined focus on poverty and its autonomous status. The current round of vaccine diplomacy on all sides is neither.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/385538/original/file-20210222-15-1qvu06p.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&h=503&fit=crop&dpr=1,"February 22, 2021",The Conversation,Vaccine diplomacy: how some countries are using COVID to enhance their soft power,

2022/0049,Article,https://dailyasianage.com/news/247411/vaccine-apartheid,"The American pharmaceutical company Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech have announced that the Covid-19 vaccine they are jointly developing was more than 90% effective in early clinical trials. The news raised hopes around the world that life may soon return to pre-pandemic normal.

Those hopes may not last long. The announcement also sent governments scrambling to lay claim to vaccine doses, apparently realizing a bleak prediction: wealthy countries and individuals will monopolize early doses of any effective vaccine.

The Covid-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX) - led by the World Health Organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance - was established precisely to prevent this outcome. The COVAX Facility aims to accelerate Covid-19 vaccine development, secure doses for all countries, and distribute those doses fairly, beginning with the highest-risk groups. In other words, the facility was created partly to prevent hoarding by rich-country governments.

So far, more than 180 countries, representing nearly two-thirds of the world's population, have joined. This includes 94 higher-income countries, all of which have made legally binding commitments. All will have access to the vaccines in the COVAX list, and pay for their doses individually. The 92 lower-income countries that are parties to the facility will receive their doses free of charge.

The COVAX plan would have the vaccine distributed in two phases. In the first phase, all participating countries would receive doses proportionate to their populations. It would begin with enough vaccines to immunize the 3% of their population at highest risk, especially frontline workers in health and social care. Additional doses would then be delivered, until immunization covers 20% of each country's population - beginning with others most in danger from Covid-19, such as the elderly and those with co-morbidities.

In the second phase, vaccines would be delivered to specific countries based on how quickly the virus is spreading; whether other pathogens (like measles) are also spreading; and how vulnerable the country's health infrastructure is to being overwhelmed. Given the constraints at work - the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine, for example, must be administered in two doses three weeks apart, and only 1.35 billion doses, at most, will be produced by the end of next year - it is difficult to imagine a fairer system.

And yet there are major barriers to the system's implementation. First and foremost, while China finally joined COVAX in early October, the United States has not.

Of course, given his ""America First"" approach, US President Donald Trump surprised no one by refusing to join. There is, however, reason to hope that President-elect Joe Biden will be more receptive. After all, Biden plans to re-join many international agreements from which Trump withdrew, and has already established a Covid-19 task force. Seth Berkley, the head of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is set to hold talks with Biden's team.

Meanwhile, China has been working aggressively and largely independently to develop and test its own vaccine. At least four candidates are currently undergoing Phase-3 trials. Though none are yet proven, Chinese officials have reportedly attempted to inoculate tens of thousands of people - possibly many more - outside the traditional testing process.

But there is another problem: COVAX participants are still competing to secure bilateral deals with pharmaceutical companies, as there is no rule against it. The United Kingdom, for example, has reserved 40 million doses of the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine. Several other European governments have also placed orders, or are negotiating deals.

Moreover, the European Union has finalized a deal for up to 300 million doses. The US, with its population of 328 million, has ordered 100 million doses, with the rights to acquire 500 million more - a target so high that it smacks of an attempt to corner the market. Brazil - another COVAX participant - is also in talks with Pfizer, as are many others.

Within days of its announcement, Pfizer had sold more than 80% of the vaccine doses it will be able to produce by the end of next year to governments representing only 14% of the global population. In other words, if this is the first safe and effective vaccine to get to market, the vast majority of the world's population will have almost no access to it.

Many other vaccine candidates - there are currently over 200, around 50 of which are in the clinical-trial phase - are also spoken for. Rich-country governments have already cut deals for privileged access to vaccines being developed by Moderna (which has also reported promising results from clinical trials), Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca, among others, should these candidates make it through the approval process. Obviously, low-income countries do not have this option.

Because a pandemic can be overcome only when it is overcome everywhere, embracing an every-country-for-itself approach would seem irrational. And yet, as the unseemly competition for vaccine doses indicates, that is exactly what many countries have done. Unless we change course, global health apartheid will become increasingly entrenched and drive inequality to new heights. And the pandemic will still be with us. We will have merely added new problems to the one we didn't solve.",https://dailyasianage.com/library/1605635139_4.jpg,18 November 2020,daily asian age,Vaccine Apartheid,
2022/0050,Article,https://en.prothomalo.com/opinion/op-ed/vaccine-diplomacy-indias-ban-lessons-learned,"When the Covid-19 pandemic broke out towards the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020, health experts observed the trends in the virus and concluded that the only way to tackle this was by means of extensive vaccinations to create herd immunity. Efforts kicked off from then to come up with a vaccine and within a short time, several vaccines were developed. Vaccines are now being administered all over the world, though poorer countries have not been that successful in procuring the vaccines.

Serum Institute of India has been manufacturing and marketing the vaccine development by Oxford-AstraZeneca. In November last year, Beximco Pharma signed a deal with Serum Institute to supply our health department with 30 million (3 crore) doses of the vaccine. The Bangladesh government has already paid in advance for 15 million (1.5 crore) doses. Serum was supposed to have supplied Beximco with the vaccine over a period of six months, in consignments of five million (50 lakh) doses every month.

The first consignment of five million (50 lakh) doses reached on 25 January 2021. The second consignment, this time of two million (20 lakh) doses, arrived in the last week of February. The remaining doses of the second consignment were to arrive in the first week of March. Around the same time, more vaccines were to arrive as a grant from COVAX.

None of these vaccines have arrived. In total, Bangladesh had received a bit over 10 million (1 crore) doses from India, inclusive of 3.2 million (32 lakh) doses given as a gift. Till 25 April, 58,18,000 (58 lakh 18 thousand) people were given the first dose of the vaccine. The second doses began to be administered from 8 April and so far 23,27,000 (23 lakh 27 thousand) have been given the second dose. Another 3.5 million (35 lakh) doses are required for those who have received the first dose, but there are only 2.1 million (21 lakh) doses of vaccines in stock.

Right at this juncture, an unprecedented spread of coronavirus has struck India and at the same time, for various reasons Serum Institute failed to reach its targeted production of the vaccine. Struggling to tackle the crisis, the Indian government has halted export of the vaccine. This decision has become a nightmare for Bangladesh. From Monday, the administering the first dose has been halted. In additional to that, the second dose has become uncertain for around 1.3 million (13 lakh) to 1.4 million (14 lakh) people.

Though the Bangladesh government has paid for the vaccine in advance, no government agency signed any agreement with Serum Institute. It was the private company Beximco that signed the agreement and so Beximco should now put pressure on Serum Institute.

We tend to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted. Now that we are in this crisis, what lessons have we learned? Firstly, it was foolhardy to rely on one single source for such a massive initiative
The Beximco managing director said they are making an effort in this regard and it would be good if the government made an effort too. On 24 April he advised that India be ‘sternly addressed’. The agreement between Beximco and Serum is a business contract. So it is Beximco who can deal with them firmly, not the government.

Diplomatically speaking, Bangladesh can make an appeal and it has done that. Initially India responded, expressing its regret at not being able to do anything in this regard. But it will not do to give up. Diplomatic efforts must continue so that Bangladesh get at least the 80 million (8 lakh) doses for which it has already paid. And at least 2 million (20 lakh) doses must be supplied before our existing stock exhausts on 15 May so that those who have taken the first dose, can get the second.

Bangladesh has taken up vaccine diplomacy outside of India too. Russia and China have been approached for vaccines. Bangladesh has also consented to join the platform created by China to build up a vaccine bank for countries in South Asia, outside of India. Efforts are also being made to get some vaccines from COVAX on an emergency basis.",https://images.prothomalo.com/prothomalo-english%2F2021-04%2F41b09b10-ebf7-4377-b4eb-f67d2fddc5bc%2Fv.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&format=webp&w=640&dpr=1.5,27 Apr 2021,Prothom Alo,"Vaccine diplomacy, India’s ban, lessons learned",

Under the Vaccine Maitri initiative, while India had gifted the Serum Institute of India (SII)-manufactured Covishield vaccines to its friends in the neighbourhood, countries such as  Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have also bought millions of doses from the vaccine maker directly.

A large chunk of their orders are pending, official sources told ThePrint. They added that vaccines being produced in India have to be “repurposed” to meet the country’s own demands and that there are no immediate plans to resume the exports. 

India has also suspended its global vaccine sharing COVAX commitment, which has also impacted these countries.

Jaishankar, however, said India had to give the vaccines to the neighbourhood as it was about a pandemic breaking out “right across your doorstep.” ",https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Covishield.jpg?compress=true&quality=80&w=800&dpr=1.5,"7 May, 2021",The Print,"Even if WTO waives patent rights, no country can start making a Covid vaccine immediately",
2022/0052,Article,https://ti-health.org/content/is-covid-19-vaccine-nationalism-corruption/,"Only about a year ago, the World Health Organization approved the first COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, fuelling hopes that it would soon help beat the pandemic. However, what started as hope for a global and joint response hasn’t benefited everyone equally. Very early on, vaccine nationalism led high-income countries to hoard enough doses to vaccinate their populations several times over. The spread of new variants such as Delta and Omicron have demonstrated that the pandemic is far from over – and high-income countries are now rushing to administer booster shots for non-risk groups in an attempt to protect against the new variants. 

At the same time, the majority of risk groups – including the elderly and health care workers – in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have not even received their first dose; a trend the WHO has warned risks exacerbating inequities in global vaccine access, giving the coronavirus a boost by enabling it to mutate more often as it replicates and spreads faster among unvaccinated populations. 

On the occasion of International Anti-Corruption Day on 9 December, Transparency International Sweden and The Swedish Anti-Corruption Institute hosted an event at the Swedish Chamber of Commerce in Stockholm exploring corruption in several sectors, including protection against retaliation for whistle-blowers and how companies operating in complex markets can tackle corruption.  

The event also hosted a discussion on how corruption and inequitable vaccine access is hindering the success of the global COVID-19 vaccination campaign with speakers Anna Mia Ekström, clinical professor in infectious disease epidemiology at the Karolinska Institute and an expert member of the WHO-COVAX Independent Allocation of Vaccines Group (IAVG) for global COVID-19 vaccine allocation; Maurice Nyambe, executive director of Transparency International Zambia; and Jonathan Cushing, head of Transparency International’s Global Health Programme. The session was moderated by Transparency International Sweden’s Chair Ulrik Åshuvud. Here are some of the main takeaways from the discussion about COVID-19 vaccines.

HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES MUST DO MORE FOR VACCINE EQUITY
Transparency International defines corruption as “abuse of entrusted power for private gain” and starting off the COVID-19 vaccine session, Ulrik Åshuvud, Chair of Transparency International Sweden, explained how corruption is “affecting development and democracy, as well as the ongoing efforts to respond to the pandemic and the fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals.”

The term “No one is safe until everyone is safe” was meant to spread public awareness about the importance of COVID-19 vaccine doses being shared globally and immediately. Yet, many countries have not acted accordingly. As of 15 December, an average of 66.33% of individuals in high-income countries have been vaccinated, compared to only 9.02% in low-income countries, according to the UNDP’s global dashboard for vaccine equity. These numbers hide even worse disparities between countries – the Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, has vaccinated less than 1% of its population with at least one dose while Canada has vaccinated 82% of its population with at least one dose. In Sweden, 85% of the population has received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

Ekström highlighted that the main bottleneck for ensuring equitable distribution of vaccines has so far been the shortage of supplies fuelled by high-income countries bypassing COVAX in “the queue” and instead creating direct, bilateral agreements with manufacturers – making it difficult for COVAX to predict and allocate the number of vaccines it will get. 

For countries without bilateral agreements with manufacturers – mainly LMICs – this has meant a very irregular and limited supply of vaccines. Contrary to the initial objective of distributing vaccines equitably across the world, COVAX has instead become dependent on donated doses.

According to Ekström, unequal access to vaccines means that there are now five times more booster doses being distributed to already fully vaccinated populations in high-income countries than there are primary [first] doses being distributed to unvaccinated populations in low-income countries. “It doesn’t get any better” [as the vaccine roll out continues] she said.

But Ekström was optimistic as supplies of vaccines [to LMICs] have been increasing dramatically over the past months. The main issues will hopefully be around improving the absorption capacity of countries and to ensure vaccine demand increases. More resources will be needed to train the necessary health personnel to administer the vaccines and to support public vaccination campaigns, she said.

An equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines is needed not only to prevent the direct health effects of the virus, but also the indirect consequences caused by the fear and lockdowns –which have pushed more than 160 million people into extreme poverty, Ekström concluded.

MISTRUST IN GOVERNMENT AND MISINFORMATION FUEL HESITANCY
“The issue of vaccines in Zambia elicits a lot of passionate debate,” said Transparency International Zambia’s executive director Maurice Nyambe, who joined the event via livestream from Zambia. The issue has become very polarized, with one side of the population strongly opposing the vaccines and the other being very pro-vaccines – each group passionately defending their position, he explained. 

A lot of the vaccine hesitancy is fuelled by political connotations, as well as mistrust in the government. Opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema – who initially ran on an anti-vaccine platform – won the contested presidential election in August this year. Since stepping into power, his party has changed their position to becoming pro-vaccines, a shift that has given rise to mistrust from many Zambians according to Nyambe.

Initial results from a survey carried out by Transparency International Zambia showed that vaccines remain a polarizing issue and that more awareness raising is needed in order to address some of the myths and misconceptions, said Nyambe. The survey also looked at people’s main sources of information, with half of respondents saying television was their main source of news, whereas about 20% said they got most of their information from social media. “With social media comes quite a big risk of misinformation so we want to look at this in our analysis,” he added.

Long-term corruption creates distrust – something we see play out in a crisis like this, according to Ekström, “you can’t build trust in a short time and suddenly expect people to trust.” Many undemocratic governments have taken outrageous measures, including strict lockdowns and curfews in the name of public health. In reality, they were implemented for political reasons rather than for science-based health reasons, she explained. “We need to build trust long term and that’s one of the lessons learned from this pandemic.”

CORRUPTION CREATES BARRIERS FOR VACCINATION AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE 
Transparency International’s Head of Global Health, Jonathan Cushing, highlighted that “we see a situation now where high-income countries are delivering booster doses, but the reality for many people in the world is very different.” 

One of his key messages was that transparency and equity within countries has looked very different – from accusations of nepotism in Sweden and many other countries around the world to demands for bribes for vaccination in Uganda. The amounts being requested for bribes in relation to SEK or Euro are quite low, but put in relation to the daily wages in for example Uganda, the bribes are quite high, Cushing explained. 

The low supply of vaccines in LMICs has created a situation where people are willing to use personal connections to access vaccines. As vaccine mandates are increasing, Transparency International has also received reports of people attempting to by-pass the system by paying for vaccine certificates without having been vaccinated in order to be able to return to work and making a livelihood. This can be due to shortage of vaccines or due to vaccine hesitancy. In early December, the WHO Europe Director, Dr Hans Kluge, told a press conference that vaccinations should not be made mandatory “if you haven’t reached out first to the communities.” 

SHORT-NOTICE VACCINE DONATIONS MAKE EQUITABLE ALLOCATION HARDER
Some countries are choosing to directly donate earmarked doses to specific LMICs – and exclude others from receiving them – sometimes based on political reasons, explained Ekström. “We would of course prefer that contracts are transferred directly to COVAX so that we can distribute [vaccines] according to need and make sure that the countries lagging behind can at least reach 10% or 20% [vaccination rates] before we start topping up countries that have fairly high rates,” she said.

The main issue with donated doses is that they often have a short shelf life. Too often, high-income countries that have procured more doses than they can absorb end up donating doses that are close to expiring. The receiving country gets little to no notice before having to distribute them – often across health systems that are understaffed and under-resourced – making equitable distribution almost impossible.

Bangladesh, Zambia, and Uganda – the three countries where Transparency International’s Global Health Programme works – all attempted an equity based roll out to start with, but later faced challenges in continuing to target those most in need.

“One common denominator across the three countries is that officially or unofficially, the equity-based principles of distribution have largely been abandoned. It’s now very much a first-come first served approach,” Cushing said. This is driven in part by the short shelf life of doses and the lack of doses. In order to not waste doses that are about to expire, many countries are forced to simply distribute them around the airports where they arrive.

Transparency International Sweden’s Chair Ulrik Åshuvud ended the session by asking the audience to consider the question “Is the delay in distributing vaccines equally around the globe to be seen as corruption in itself?” Referring back to Transparency International’s definition of corruption he asked, “is it abuse of entrusted power for your own country’s gain?”",,"December 23, 2021",Transparency International,IS COVID-19 VACCINE NATIONALISM CORRUPTION?,
2022/0053,News,https://www.thedailystar.net/health/disease/coronavirus/fallouts-fightback/vaccine/news/covid-19-vaccination-bangladesh-role-model-3000961#main-content,"Bangladesh's Covid-19 vaccination campaign has so far turned out to be quite a triumph.

What started amid a cloud of scepticism about 14 months ago forged ahead, thanks to the government's quick thinking, smart diplomacy and people's enthusiasm in getting the jabs that would offer them protection against severe disease from coronavirus.

The World Health Organisation has set a target to vaccinate 70 percent of the global population with a two-dose regimen by the middle of 2022.

As of April 6, Bangladesh has administered one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to 75.25 percent of the population, two doses to 67.37 percent and three doses to 9.10 percent -- figures that are the envy of many upper middle-income countries.

""People are saying that the government's vaccination programme has been a success,"" Health Minister Zahid Maleque told The Daily Star recently.

It is because of the success of the vaccination campaign that the economy is roaring, shops are buzzing with customers, students are back in the classrooms and social and religious activities are taking place unhindered, he said.

And despite the return to normalcy, infections and fatalities have remained low. For instance, Bangladesh yesterday reported just 48 fresh infections and, for the fourth day in a row, no deaths from Covid-19.

""The way we have been able to operate the vaccination programme is an example for the world. I don't know if any country in the world could administer one crore doses of vaccines in a single day,"" the minister said, adding that almost all eligible persons have received two shots of the vaccine.

But it has not always been smooth-sailing.

Bangladesh's vaccine roll-out began in January last year with AstraZeneca doses purchased from Serum Institute of India by way of Beximco Pharmaceuticals and commitments of 6.8 crore doses from Covax, a WHO-backed programme to provide shots to developing nations, by 2021.

After providing less than a third of the three crore doses agreed upon earlier, Serum discontinued supplies in April last year following an export ban slapped by the Indian government in the wake of a devastating wave of coronavirus cases in the neighbouring country.

Covax's pledge to supply vaccines to low-income countries also fell short due to ""vaccine nationalism"" by the high-income countries.

The twin developments had put the government's vaccination programme in a pickle.

But it compelled the government to dig deep for a new strategy. It courted nations through the diplomatic channels for shots, particularly of the AstraZeneca vaccines, and also decided to purchase 7.7 crore doses of the Sinopharm vaccine from China.

Soon, the vaccines started trickling in and the campaign picked up pace.

Supplies are only one part of a vaccination campaign; distribution and delivery are the other aspects, where many countries came undone.

To ensure that the vaccines are shot into as many arms of the targeted population, the government ran several special drives. The result was people flocking to vaccination centres.

As of March 27, Bangladesh received 29.64 crore doses from various sources, including gifts and Covax cost-sharing agreements, according to a report prepared by the health ministry on the status of vaccination.

The government bought 9.2 crore doses of vaccines -- 1.5 crore from Serum and 7.7 crore from Sinopharm -- under bilateral agreements.

Besides, the country got 9.62 crore shots in donations from Covax, 8.71 crore in cost-sharing agreement with Covax and 2.1 crore as gifts from countries with a surplus.

The government has spent about Tk 13,311 crore for purchasing and transporting vaccines, according to the finance ministry's cost estimation.

The amount includes $741 million of the $940 million the government got from the Asian Development Bank as loan.

About $75 million was given to Serum for the 1.5 crore doses of Covishield vaccines and another $550 million was spent for procuring vaccines under bilateral agreements.

The government is now mulling over readjusting the allocation for vaccine procurement, said a finance ministry official requesting anonymity.

There are enough doses, so the remaining $200 million from the ADB loan might not be needed.

""We have enough stock in hand. What we need now is administering the vaccines within the shortest possible time. Otherwise, the vaccines may go out of date,"" said a health ministry official preferring anonymity.",,"Apr 9, 2022",The Daily Star,"Covid-19 vaccination: Bangladesh a role model

As countries scramble to secure Covid-19 vaccines, ugly expressions like ""vaccine race"" and ""vaccine nationalism"" have entered the global lexicon. But, at a time when global cooperation in sharing vaccines is minimal, and the World Health Organization's vaccine-distribution plans are yet to get off the ground, India has taken a different tack, quietly pursuing ""vaccine diplomacy."" Its ""Vaccine Maitri"" (Vaccine Friendship) campaign has shipped hundreds of thousands of Indian-made Covishield vaccines, manufactured under license from Oxford-AstraZeneca, to some 60 countries.

India is a global pharmaceutical powerhouse, manufacturing some 20 percent of all generic medicines and accounting for as much as 62 percent of global vaccine production, so it was quick off the mark when the pandemic struck. Before Covid-19 vaccines were developed, India supplied some 100 countries with hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol, and sent pharmaceuticals, test kits, and other equipment to around 90 countries. Later, even before the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was approved, Adar Poonawalla, the 40-year-old head of the privately-owned Serum Institute of India, audaciously decided to manufacture it—a billion-dollar gamble. When approvals came, SII was able to churn out millions of doses, making them available to the government both for domestic use and export.

Indian vaccines have been flown to most of the country's neighbours, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Myanmar, and Nepal, and also farther afield, to the Seychelles, Cambodia, Mongolia, and Pacific Island, Caribbean, and African countries. Vaccines have helped mend strained relations with Bangladesh and cement friendly ties with the Maldives.

To be sure, China and Russia are promoting their own vaccines, and western drug companies are raking in a publicity bonanza (along with a share-price windfall). But in developing vaccines for its own use, the Global North overlooked the prohibitive cost of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for poorer countries. Indian-made vaccines, on the other hand, are reportedly safe, cost-effective, and—unlike some others—do not require storage and transport at very low temperatures.

India's vaccine diplomacy is, of course, not purely altruistic. When the country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, laid the foundations of India's science and technology infrastructure, his intentions were expressed in noble, humanist, and universalist terms. But his successors have long recognised how India can leverage its scientific and medical skills to enhance its geopolitical standing. At a time when most richer countries are criticised for hoarding vaccine doses, India stands out for having sent 33 million to poorer countries, with millions more in the pipeline.

There is also an unspoken subtext: rivalry with China, with which tensions have intensified following clashes along the Himalayan frontier. Not only has India overshadowed China as a provider of cheap and accessible vaccines to the Global South; it has been quicker and more effective. For example, China has announced 300,000 doses for Myanmar but is yet to deliver any, while India quickly supplied 1.7 million. Similarly, Indian vaccines beat China's into Cambodia and Afghanistan.

When a credibility crisis consumed China's vaccines in pandemic-ravaged Brazil, with polls showing 50 percent of Brazilians surveyed unwilling to take the Sinovac vaccine, President Jair Bolsonaro turned to India, which came through promptly. Tweeting his thanks, Bolsonaro illustrated his gratitude with an image from India's Ramayana epic, depicting Lord Hanuman carrying an entire mountain to deliver the life-saving herb Sanjeevani booti to Lanka.

Indian vaccines are arriving even in richer countries. The United Kingdom has ordered ten million doses from SII. Canada, whose prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has riled his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, more than once, telephoned Modi to ask for two million vaccines; the first half-million were delivered within days. Trudeau effusively declared that the world's victory over Covid-19 would be ""because of India's tremendous pharmaceutical capacity, and Prime Minister Modi's leadership in sharing this capacity with the world.""

India is using the country's capacity in this sector subtly to advertise an alternative to China's economic and geopolitical dominance. While China has been secretive in releasing data about its vaccines, leading to controversies over the efficacy of them, India organised trips for foreign ambassadors to visit pharmaceutical factories in Pune and Hyderabad.

The contrast with the behaviour of wealthier countries is no less striking. According to Duke University's Global Health Institute, developed countries with 16 percent of the world's population—including Canada, the United States, and the UK, each of whom have guaranteed enough supplies to vaccinate their populations several times over—have secured 60 percent of global vaccine supplies for themselves. Other countries commandeering supplies exceeding their domestic needs include Australia, Chile, and several European Union members.

The world is paying attention to India as it shares its available vaccine supplies, instead of choosing the nationalist course of blocking exports. India has also offered 1.1 billion vaccine doses to the WHO's COVAX programme to distribute Covid-19 vaccines to poorer countries. As Modi has tweeted, ""We are all together in the fight against this pandemic. India is committed to sharing resources, experiences, and knowledge for global good.""

If there is a concern, it is that India has exported three times as many doses as it has administered to its own people. The country is lagging behind its own target of immunising 300 million people by August, after vaccinating some three million health-care workers in a campaign that began on January 16. And mounting concern about rising case numbers, the emergence of Covid-19 variants that may not respond to existing vaccines, and an economy that has not yet fully recovered, will intensify the challenge India confronts in fulfilling its obligations to developing countries while also meeting domestic demand.

Meeting that challenge is a vital national interest. India's vaccine diplomacy has been a boon to the country's aspirations to be recognised as a global power. In combating the pandemic, it has gone well beyond the routine provision of health care or the supply of generics. To be sure, it is uncertain whether promoting soft power through health-care exports significantly boosts a country's position in the global order. But if and when the permanent seats at the United Nations Security Council are ever rearranged, grateful governments will know who has done the most to save a world reeling from the onslaught of a deadly pathogen.

2022/0055,News,https://www.voanews.com/a/covid-19-pandemic_india-launches-neighborly-vaccine-diplomacy/6201140.html,"In an unusual diplomatic initiative, India has donated millions of doses of the British-developed AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine being produced in the country to neighboring South Asian nations.

The “vaccine diplomacy” aims to raise New Delhi’s global profile and push back against China, which has been expanding its influence in South Asia, analysts say.

“It’s about image and soft power. India wants to be recognized as a global leader,” Sreeram Chaulia, dean at the Jindal School of International Affairs, said.

As the world’s largest vaccine producer, India is set to be at the forefront of supplying affordable shots against COVID-19 to low- and middle-income countries. An Indian company, the Serum Institute of India, has joined with AstraZeneca to make the vaccine.

Shipments of the vaccine landed in recent days in Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Maldives, Myanmar, Mauritius and Seychelles, just days after India launched its own nationwide inoculation program.The vaccine will be sent to Sri Lanka and Afghanistan after it gets approval in those countries.

However, India’s rival Pakistan, which has approved the AstraZeneca vaccine, is conspicuously absent from the list of recipients.

“As far as Pakistan [is concerned], I am not aware of any request for India-made vaccines,” Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in response to a query at a regular press briefing.

The low-cost and easily storable AstraZeneca vaccine is in huge demand in developing countries struggling to vaccinate their populations.New Delhi has given its diplomatic initiative its own hashtag, “VaccineMaitri#” or “Vaccine friendship.” The goodwill gesture comes amid growing criticism of “vaccine inequality” or unequal access to vaccines between rich and developing countries and has won praise from India’s smaller neighbors.

""Friendly nations help each other. India has helped us today with vaccine; just like they forwarded their helping hand in our Liberation War,” said Zahid Maleque, Bangladesh’s health minister.

“A friend in need is a friend indeed,"" he said.

As the pandemic puts the spotlight on India as a “vaccine powerhouse,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi has emphasized that it will prioritize South Asian countries in access to vaccine supplies.

“We will continue to give due importance to our Neighborhood First policy while collectively fighting the pandemic,” he said in a recent tweet.China, too, has given its locally developed vaccines to countries such as Indonesia and Turkey, and promised it to many others across Africa, Asia and South America.

However, South Asian countries such as Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had asked India for supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine, developed in Britain.

“India would like to make a point that in this area, unlike in some others where China usually overshadows India in terms of military and economic might, in this field, in pharmaceuticals, in affordable health care, India has actually a comparative edge and advantage over China,” Chaulia said.

“That will be a subtle message going around that you can depend on us, that we did not create the problem but we will be part of the solution,” he said.

New Delhi has also started commercial shipments of vaccines — the first consignments have landed in Brazil and Morocco and are also set to go to South Africa and Saudi Arabia.“Keeping in view the domestic requirements of the phased rollout, India will continue to supply vaccines to partner countries in the coming weeks and months in a phased manner,” Srivastava said.

Modi has said that India will play a frontline role in providing vaccines — both AstraZeneca’s and another one developed by an Indian company that also has been approved for emergency use.

""Today India, with not one but two made in India vaccines, is ready to protect humanity,” Modi told a virtual convention of nonresident Indians earlier this month.

“Being pharmacy of the world, India has supplied essential medicines to the needy across the globe in the past and is doing it today as well,” he said.

In recent months, Indian companies have been ramping up production to meet the unprecedented demand for COVID-19 vaccines. The Serum Institute of India has already stockpiled 80 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and is churning out 50 million doses a month. Some of those vaccines will also be provided to the World Health Organization-backed COVAX initiative to give vaccines to poor countries.

While inoculation programs are underway in rich countries, developing countries are struggling to secure supplies and begin vaccinating their people. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus recently said that the world is “on the brink of a moral catastrophic failure” for its unequal sharing of COVID-19 vaccinations and warned that a ""me-first approach"" in distributing vaccines “will only prolong the pandemic.”",https://gdb.voanews.com/afe9ffd9-7a91-4614-ad5f-201af1928074_w650_r0_s.jpg,"January 24, 2021",voa news,India Launches 'Neighborly Vaccine Diplomacy',

Bangla-desh is facing one of its worst weeks since the Covid-19 pandemic first hit the country in March last year. On Monday, we saw the highest daily death toll since the pandemic began (164 lives lost) and yesterday, we had the highest number of new Covid-19 infections detected over 24 hours (11,525 new cases). Yesterday was the third day in a row where the daily death toll went over 150. The positivity rate is currently at 31.46 percent.

Amidst this worsening situation, the only silver lining is that we finally have vaccines in store, ready to be distributed across the country. A consignment of 106,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine under Covax, the global vaccine alliance, reached Dhaka on May 31, and 11 lakh doses of the Sinopharm vaccine were gifted by the Chinese government at around the same time. Early this month, 25 lakh Moderna vaccines provided by Covax and another 20 lakh shots of Sinopharm vaccines bought from China, also arrived. According to reports, Bangladesh will be purchasing seven crore Johnson & Johnson vaccines from Covax as well.

After the sudden vaccine drought faced by the country when Serum Institute of India failed to deliver its promised shipments to Dhaka, the resumption of the vaccination programme is a light at the end of what often feels like an endless tunnel. The government has recently announced that the vaccination registration process will be open to the general public from Thursday, with anyone from 35 years of age being able to register.

While this is good news indeed, we must remind ourselves that only a meagre 3.5 percent of the country's total population has been vaccinated so far. According to Prothom Alo, we have received 1.6 crore doses of vaccines since the pandemic began. To reach the government's target of vaccinating 80 percent of the population, we require over 25 crore doses. With limited resources and with the very real issue of global vaccine inequality still looming large—according to Our World in Data, only one percent of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose of the country, a situation that WHO Director-General termed as ""vaccine apartheid""—what steps can be taken to make vaccine access more equitable within Bangladesh?

If we look at DGHS data on the vaccination campaign that began on February 7, before grinding to a halt on April 26, there already exist a few glaring disparities. The most obvious is the gender divide—out of the 58 lakh people who have received the first dose of the vaccine, only 38 percent were women.

It also comes as no surprise that the most vaccines have been administered in Dhaka division, where over 18 lakh have received at least one dose, and over 15 lakh received both. While this might have made sense in February, the current situation in other divisions gives us every reason to regret this lack of foresight. Barishal division, for example, is experiencing positivity rates up to 54 percent, but only 1.8 lakh people there have received both vaccine doses. This excessive centralisation of the public health system has not only affected people outside of Dhaka in terms of vaccine uptake, but in all aspects of the Covid-19 crisis. Already, there are growing concerns of limited oxygen supplies, a lack of ICUs in many district hospitals, as well as basic equipment such as high flow nasal cannulas—not to mention the dearth of Covid testing facilities (according to a recent report in this daily, Rangpur, Mymensingh and Barishal have only two RT-PCR labs in each division, compared to Dhaka division's 88).

While there is no specific data available on those who have received their first vaccine dose so far, it would not be unfair to assume that the digital registration process can create significant difficulties for the digitally illiterate, or for people on the wrong side of the digital divide. Even of the 46 million internet users in Bangladesh (which in itself is less than a third of the population), being online does not necessarily demonstrate digital literacy. A 2019 survey conducted by the BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD) on 6,500 rural households found that, of the 40 percent of respondents who had regular internet access, only about 13 percent were able to navigate the homepage of the Department of Immigration and Passports, where the information is clearly marked in Bangla, in order to retrieve information for passport applications. BIGD research associate Maria Matin, in an article in The Daily Star, detailed how it also took the respondents ""two to three minutes per information, which should be a matter of seconds for anyone with some digital literacy.""

In this context, how do we ensure that it is not just the urban, tech-savvy groups who continue to register for and receive vaccines? Last month, it was announced that migrant workers, medical students, residential students of government universities and law enforcers will receive vaccines on a priority basis. According to Prothom Alo, the government will also target farmers, industrial workers and transport workers, and the relevant ministries have been asked to prepare a list of recipients. Targeting workers in specific sectors is a commendable step, and one that must be taken urgently. I would request the authorities to also include the city corporations in this initiative, so that the sanitation workers, garbage collectors and cleaners who have silently kept our cities functioning throughout the pandemic are given adequate protections.

However, if previous experience (especially with disbursement of Covid-19 relief funds) is anything to go by, the preparation of such lists can be slow, laborious and often, flawed. Since anyone above the age of 35 will be able to register online for vaccines soon, the authorities can take some immediate steps to ensure elderly, rural and digitally illiterate populations are included in the vaccine uptake.

The most obvious one is a mass public awareness campaign, coupled with efforts to bridge the digital divide. After low vaccine registration rates in February, the government decided to engage community healthcare centres and union digital centres in helping people to register. What is stopping representatives from these centres from going to the more remote locations and registering people door-to-door? We are all familiar with the auto rickshaws/vans with loudspeakers that make an appearance during every election season. Can we not treat this awareness campaign with the same enthusiasm that manifests during election campaigns? Why not reach out to student leaders, NGOs and volunteer organisations from across the country, and engage them in helping members of their communities to register?

It must be mentioned here that urban areas do not have a version of community healthcare centres and union digital centres. So where can the urban poor go to receive assistance in registering for the vaccine? If there are any such centres, are its target groups aware of its existence? While the most recent announcements have prioritised formal workers, we are yet to see a similar push to vaccinate urban, informal workers who have been most affected by lockdowns and the resultant economic downturn. Door-to-door registration in urban slums, or setting up of centres to assist with registration in nearby areas, should be a priority for the authorities—whether done via government actors, or with the help of NGOs.

Finally, although we are seeing a push to vaccinate workers to keep the economy running, we must remember that the majority of Covid-19 deaths are happening in populations aged over 65. Since the Department of Social Services already has a list (though incomplete) of people receiving elderly and widow allowances, it would not be difficult for the authorities to reach out to them and ensure they are vaccinated. Including widows in the vaccine list would also be a step towards bridging the gender divide in vaccine uptake, as would the efforts to bring vaccine registration to the doorsteps of marginalised populations.

The attempts to take our education system online have already demonstrated the digital divide that exists in the country. When it comes to a major public health issue like mass vaccinations, we cannot allow this divide to create vaccine inequality in the country, where marginalised populations who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic end up falling through the cracks. Bangladesh's past successes with mass immunisation programmes show that we have the capacity to make the vaccine campaign more equitable—all we need now is effective planning and management to see it through.",,"Jul 7, 2021",The Daily Star,"Can we be doing more to ensure vaccine equality in Bangladesh?
",
2022/0057,UN report,https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1114762,"In September 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) set an ambitious global target. The UN health agency called for 70 per cent of the global population to be vaccinated by mid-2022.

At that point, just over three per cent of people in low-income countries had been vaccinated with at least one dose, compared to 60.18 per cent in high-income countries.

Six months on, the world is nowhere near reaching that target.

The overall number of vaccines administered has risen dramatically, but so has the inequality of the distribution: of the more than 10 billion doses given out worldwide, only one per cent have been administered in low-income countries.This means that 2.8 billion people around the world are still waiting to get their first shot.

Vaccine inequity jeopardizes the safety of everyone, and contributes for growing inequalities between – and within – countries. Not only does this state of affairs risk prolonging the pandemic, but the lack of equity has many other impacts, slowing the economic recovery of entire countries, global labour markets, public debt payments, and countries’ ability to invest in other priorities.

Recovery harder than ever
Two years on from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, poorer countries are finding it harder than ever to recover economically, labour markets are suffering, public debt remains stubbornly high, and there is little left in the coffers to invest in other priorities.

New analysis by UNDP shows that most of the vulnerable countries are found in Sub-Saharan Africa, including Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Chad, where less than one percent of the populations are fully vaccinated. Outside of Africa, Haiti and Yemen are still to reach two percent coverage.Where do we go from here?
Urgent access to vaccines and financing – such as the grants and concessions proposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) –  is, according to the analysis, essential for the poorest countries, alongside support that is tailored to the situation faced by each individual nation.

Many, for example, have benefited from vaccination campaigns undertaken by international organizations, and this experience can inform the way that COVID-19 vaccinations are conducted.

And the Global Dashboard for Vaccine Equity, developed by UNDP, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the University of Oxford, is helping researchers and policy-makers to run their own analysis, and develop the programs that can most effectively benefit their citizens, and go some way to addressing global inequality.

If vaccine equity is not dealt with soon, the consequences could be grave.  As the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said on 10 March, greater cooperation between countries is needed to stop the pandemic fast, whilst delayed vaccination could lead to escalated societal tensions and violence, and a lost decade for development.

The studies show that, if low-income countries had the same vaccination rate as high-income countries in September last year (around 54 per cent) they would have increased their GDP by US$16.27 billion in 2021.

The countries calculated to have lost most potential income during the pandemic, due to vaccine inequity, are Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda.

This lost income could have been used to address other pressing development challenge in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that make up the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the organization’s blueprint for a future that is fair for people and the planet.

In South Sudan, for example, the costs associated with COVID-19 vaccinations could have covered all social assistance programmes and education expenditure in the country, whilst in Burundi, the costs could have provided healthcare for some 4.7 million people.

Whilst the protracted lockdowns put in place worldwide hurt workers everywhere, those in developing countries were, again, disproportionately affected. Richer countries softened the blow by boosting economic support to both formal and informal workers, while in low-income countries, support declined between 2020 and 2021.",https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Libraries/Production+Library/29-07-2021_UNDP_Yemen.jpg/image1170x530cropped.jpg,28 March 2022,UN News,UN analysis shows link between lack of vaccine equity and widening poverty gap,

South Africa and India have urged fellow WTO members to waive IP rights on vaccines to boost production. Poorer countries that make up half the world's population have received just 17% of doses, a situation the World Health Organization head has labelled ""vaccine apartheid"".

U.S. President Joe Biden said last week he supported the waiver idea, but the European Union and other developed country opponents said it will not increase output.

Speaking to the European Parliament on Thursday, WTO director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said it was clear that an IP waiver alone would not be enough.

""To have solved the unacceptable problem of inequity of access to vaccines, we have to be holistic. It's not one or the other,"" she said, adding this could not drag out for years.The European Commission outlined a plan on Wednesday it sees as a more effective way of boosting output, using existing WTO rules, rather than a waiver. It notes countries can grant licences to manufacturers to produce with or without the patent-holder's consent. read more

Bolivia signed a deal last week with a Canadian company Biolyse Pharma Corp to produce the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which would require Biolyse to secure authorisation from Johnson & Johnson or a ""compulsory licence"" from Canada.

Okonjo-Iweala said developing countries had complained the licencing process was cumbersome and should be improved.

Manufacturers should work to expand production, she said, pointing to idle capacity in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, Senegal, South Africa.

There also needed to be a transfer of technology and know-how, with vaccines often harder to produce than drugs.

2022/0059,News,https://theprint.in/diplomacy/even-if-wto-waives-patent-rights-no-country-can-start-making-a-covid-vaccine-immediately/653905/,"New Delhi: India, South Africa and many other developing countries will have to wait long before they can start manufacturing “copycat” versions of some of the world’s leading Covid-19 vaccines, even if the World Trade Organization (WTO) agrees to waive, temporarily, the intellectual property and patent rights on them.

While over 120 nations have supported the proposal, all 164 member countries of the WTO are yet to begin text-based negotiations on the matter in Geneva.

The US, after much dilly-dallying, Wednesday said it will “support” the move proposed by India and South Africa in October 2020, but commencing the negotiations will not be easy, sources told ThePrint.

The joint proposal by India and South Africa seeks to temporarily waive all intellectual property and patent rights provisions that come under the TRIPS Agreement of the WTO on Covid vaccines, medicines, diagnostic kits, protective gears and other products required to fight the pandemic.

The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, also known as the TRIPS Agreement, came into effect in January 1995. It is a multilateral agreement on intellectual property.

On Thursday, while presiding over the General Council meeting in Geneva, WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala lauded the US’ support and urged all member countries to commence the negotiations at the earliest.

“As I told the General Council yesterday, we need to respond urgently to COVID-19 because the world is watching and people are dying. I am pleased that the proponents are preparing a revision to their proposal and I urge them to put this on the table as soon as possible so that text-based negotiations can commence,” Okonjo-Iweala said.

She added: “It is only by sitting down together that we will find a pragmatic way forward — acceptable to all members — which enhances developing countries’ access to vaccines while protecting and sustaining the research and innovation so vital to the production of these life-saving vaccines.”

The General Council is the highest decision-making body of the WTO. The GC met on 5-6 May and TRIPS waiver proposal was one of the agenda items at the meeting.

Since the proposal was floated by India and South Africa, over 120 countries have supported it, and there have been several rounds of formal and informal meetings on this so far. The sources said while it will be “an onerous task” to get all members on board and discuss it, the US’ backing to the proposal has certainly made the task to begin negotiations much easier.

A huge opposition has now come from Germany, which believes suspending IPR for Covid vaccines will have “serious implications” on its production.

“The protection of the intellectual property is a source of innovation and it must remain so in the future,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday.

While Russia has supported the move, the European Union (EU) has said it is “ready to discuss” the matter.

Meanwhile, the US statement has impacted the country’s pharma stocks with the shares of Moderna, Novavax and Pfizer plummeting. Pharma groups in the US and EU have also criticised President Joe Biden’s administration for the decision.

Pfizer has said it’s “not at all” in favour of the waiver.

Hence, the sources said, even if the talks begin next week, it can take “a month to a year” to have a broad-based consensus.

TRIPS waiver will be just beginning of a long process
According to many experts in the field, while the waiver solves the issue of obtaining the legal right to manufacture the vaccines of other companies, that of sharing the know-how of manufacturing the vaccine still remains unsolved.

They claim waiving patents and giving access to the recipe are two different things.

“We are just halfway done. For instance, it completely depends on Pfizer, if they want to share how they manufacture the vaccine. But yes, they cannot sue you for infringing on their product. Let’s see which companies come forward in sharing the latter. Otherwise, globally we need to create pressure again on the big pharma to share technology,” said senior advocate Anand Grover, who specialises in drug patents.

Many believe it will be an incredible opportunity for India to harness its manufacturing capacities to fulfil its own demand, followed by that of several countries across the world.

Despite exporting millions of Covid-19 vaccines, India’s manufacturing capacity has remained under-utilised, said Achal Prabhala, a vaccine supply expert who is a fellow at the Shuttleworth Foundation.

“India’s manufacturing capacity is severely underused. We already have 24 registered vaccine manufacturers out of which only three are being used to make Covid vaccines, presently. This includes Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India, and Biological E. Panacea might soon make Covaxin as well – but what about the other 20?”

Apart from this, Prabhala said, there are several drug makers and biologics manufacturers who can jump in and make more vaccines.

“Several drug makers including Dr. Reddy’s and Hetero will be manufacturing Sputnik V. We have several hundred pharmaceutical companies in India who can potentially produce vaccines for us and for the world around,” he said.

“For instance: mRNA vaccines can be potentially produced by any pharma company that manufactures injectable drugs whereas other traditional biological vaccines can be produced by any pharmaceutical company that currently makes biologic drugs.”

Leena Menghaney, global IP advisor, MSF Access Campaign, highlighted that “as a start in India, the Drug Controller General of India needs to ensure that there is no patent linkage in the regulatory process so that emergency approvals are available to generic producers of patented medicines”.

She added: “The move will help countries such Bangladesh, Canada and others apart from India to unlock their capacities.”

What happens if TRIPS waiver comes into effect  
If all countries agree to the temporary TRIPS waiver on Covid products, several countries including India can start manufacturing the bouquet of Covid-19 vaccines instead of waiting for the pharma giants to allow domestic production.

For instance, India can begin manufacturing the vaccines including the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine apart from the long-awaited vaccine from the US drugmaker, Pfizer.

The other countries will also become eligible to start production of made-in-India Covaxin, manufactured by Bharat Biotech and AstraZeneca’s Covishield.

The move puts India again in the spotlight for aggressively increasing the production of the bouquet of vaccines at the cheapest possible price and export across the globe.

Known as a powerhouse of vaccine manufacturing, India produces 60 per cent of the world’s vaccines and accounts for 60-80 per cent of the United Nations’ annual vaccine procurement. India has exported 66 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines across the world until May 6, mainly through the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), which is the world’s largest vaccine maker.

Apart from SII, other exports were made by Hyderabad-based vaccine maker Bharat Biotech.

Move incomplete without tech transfer 
According to health experts, the manufacturer that produces the vaccine holds great amount of technical know-how and working experience that are enormously important for any company manufacturing vaccine.

This is the reason tech transfers are done under strict agreements when pharma giants make manufacturing deals with other companies. For example, UK’s AstraZeneca wanted SII to be treated as priority customer in return of accessing its technology behind the vaccine development from the Oxford University.

“The IP suspension is a step in the right direction but will probably be not enough in the absence of further support through tech transfer and guidance to set up the relevant infrastructure for quality vaccine manufacturing,” said Dr Anant Bhan, researcher in the fields of global health, health policy and bioethics.

“Trade tricks are very important, such as working experience of over the years apart from the appropriate technology, necessary infrastructure, facilities, quality norms and safeguards.”

However, experts also believe the issue of export bans and supply chain constraints is harmful for intellectual property rights.

Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the US-based Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said, “I would say that Moderna has not been worried about its patent throughout the pandemic, and no one else is making it.”

Last October, Moderna had announced that it will not enforce Covid-related patents against those making vaccines intended to combat the pandemic.

“I don’t think the suspension of intellectual property rights can be beneficial in the long run to any country because what it will do is destroy the engine of innovation that made these vaccines in the first place. The issue that needs to be corrected is export bans and supply chain constraints,” Adalja said.",https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WTOOMC.jpg?compress=true&quality=80&w=800&dpr=1.5,"7 May, 2021",The Print,"Even if WTO waives patent rights, no country can start making a Covid vaccine immediately",
2022/0060,Press Release,https://www.phrstudents.com/single-post/oppose-global-vaccine-apartheid,"In the Fall of 1884, representatives from thirteen European nations and the United States met to develop a plan to seize and divvy up the content of Africa for imperial gain. What ensued was decades of violent domination, occupation, and pillaging of natural resources in what was dubbed the “Scramble for Africa.” The colonization of indigenous people and seizure of their land has severely affected the social and economic development of their countries, with significant implications for contemporary global health.

Indeed, superimposing a map of the history of colonialism on top of a map of global COVID-19 vaccine distribution would more or less yield one image. As of May 1, over half the world’s countries have vaccinated less than 1% of their populations, ten of which have yet to vaccinate a single person. Also, 75% of vaccine doses have gone to a tiny handful of countries, a trend that is expected to continue with high- and upper-middle income countries having procured contracts to 6.3 billion out of 8.9 billion reserved doses. While the US can vaccinate its entire population multiple times over, millions of predominantly Black and Brown people in the Global South are not expected to be vaccinated until as late as 2024.

The disturbing inequities in the number of vaccine doses administered largely stem from stringent intellectual property (IP) rules implemented at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the 1990s that restrict access to life-saving medications. The WTO agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) requires all member countries to guarantee drug companies monopoly control over the public research and technology used to produce pharmaceuticals and forbids generic production. Essentially, TRIPS was designed to anchor the economic standing of low- and middle-income countries to an inescapable IP regime.

At the October 2020 Council on TRIPS meeting, India and South Africa introduced a proposal — supported by 100+ countries — calling for a temporary waiver in order to scale up local generic production of vaccines, but the US and select other countries have blocked it. Since then, 10 US Senators and hundreds of organizations* including Public Citizen, OxFam, Human Rights Watch, Justice is Global, and Physicians for Human Rights have called on President Biden to remove patent protections and commit to a people’s vaccine.

To divert these grassroots demands, Western philanthropic parties including the Gates Foundation have touted the WHO’s COVAX scheme, which is projected to vaccinate ~20% of the population of participating countries by the end of the year. However, it is has to date supplied under 50 million doses and is not operating at a fast enough pace to reach global herd immunity. Though a welcome and crucial initiative, COVAX ultimately preserves the power differential between the Global North and South and entrenches reliance on charity over self-determination. The growing movement for a people’s vaccine, in contrast, calls for justice at the point of production, not just distribution.

Critics of relieving IP restrictions claim that it is an ineffectual gesture because the main barriers lie in manufacturing capacity, not patents. But data compiled by Knowledge Ecology International (KEI) tells a very different story through current vaccine manufacturing capacity of several countries' facilities, many of whom are in queue for case-by-case negotiations with pharmaceutical manufacturers and would be able to scale up production if they had the blueprint or technical knowledge. Bangladesh-based company Incepta, for example, is on standby to make hundreds of millions of doses pending approval from Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, or Novavax.

Proponents of a people’s vaccine acknowledge the shortage of raw materials in the most impoverished nations and do not see freeing up patents as the only goal. Rather, it is only the first step. In the 1990s and 2000s, the Treatment Action Campaign and allied groups organized mass global actions to make HAART and anti-fungal drugs available to patients with HIV/AIDS in South Africa. Not only did they successfully pressure Pfizer to supply fluconazole to clinics at a sharply reduced price, but their efforts led to unprecedented investments in public health infrastructure and expansion of services. A similar feat can and must be done again.

The longer the SARS-CoV-2 virus is allowed to replicate, the greater its potential to mutate and increase in transmissibility. Most recently in India, a new variant has emerged and been linked to several countries, owing to India’s devastatingly high daily caseload of now over 400,000. This pandemic knows no borders, none of us are truly safe until all of us are safe.We must not accept a new normal in which COVID-19 becomes a relic of the Global North, but becomes endemic to the most resource-strapped pockets of the Global South.

As medical students, many of us were fortunate to be vaccinated as early January, and soon after had the opportunity to volunteer to vaccinate our communities. But we may feel powerless knowing that we cannot quite reach the arms of billions who are in dire need of a dose. The global drive to vaccinate the world has likewise called for alliances between academic institutions and on-the-ground health justice activists. We all have a role to play in ensuring that governments and pharmaceutical companies place people over profit and make available the fruits of massive public investment.

“As it stands, this proposal seems to do little to address patents beyond the existing flexibilities in the TRIPS agreement. It ignores other intellectual property barriers like trade secrets which stand in the way of vaccine manufacturers. And by focusing only on vaccines and kicking the issue of COVID-19 treatments into the long grass, it will leave life-saving treatments out of reach for millions.

We urge member states to return to the negotiating table and come back with a comprehensive waiver that will work to cut short this pandemic and guarantee everyone is protected.""

2022/0062,Article,https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/bangladesh-risks-becoming-the-next-india-without-surplus-vaccines-47317,"With the shock of India’s ongoing Covid-19 crisis, we should focus on ensuring that there isn’t another similar case. That means that vaccination efforts must speed up, not slow down, particularly in developing and middle-income countries. 

Worryingly, vaccination efforts have been disrupted by India’s second wave. 

About 30 percent of exported vaccine doses are produced in India, but the world’s largest democracy has now understandably banned vaccine exports. This means that Bangladesh will only be receiving a third of the vaccines it has ordered from India’s Serum Institute, and the 1.6 million Bangladeshis who have taken the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine may now go without a second dose.

This can only be fixed in the short-term by countries with excess vaccines, such as the US and UK, sharing their vaccine stocks. 

This was Bangladesh’s plea recently, when the Minister of Foreign Affairs told ITV news ""If the [UK] government tries, they can do it, because they have the capacity... I’m not asking for too much, I’m only asking for 1.6 million AstraZeneca doses"". 

The UK government response was negative, pointing out that the UK has already devoted £548 million ($775 million) to the COVAX programme, which has already provided vaccines to over 70 lower-income countries. 

This sounds impressive, but it misses one crucial point: the COVAX programme is not working. 

It is the COVAX programme that has been hit hard by the Indian export ban. COVAX was supposed to be the scheme that vaccinated the developing world. As it stands, 0.2 percent of the 700 million vaccine doses administered globally have been in low-income countries, compared with the 87 percent that have been administered in high or middle-income countries. 

This is because COVAX is struggling financially, and would need $3.2 billion to meet its 2021 goals. It has also been affected by bumpy international supply chains, and faces the challenge of high-income countries circumventing the COVAX programme to secure vaccines for their own citizens. 

Whilst Britain’s contribution to the COVAX programme is commendable, it will not help Bangladesh because COVAX relies on the same broken supply chains that caused this vaccine shortage in the first place. 

Theoretically, the virus may spread through Bangladesh in the same way it has spread through India. There are many similarities between the two countries and their populations: Bangladesh’s economy, like India’s, cannot be shut down. 89 percent of the total jobs in Bangladesh are informal. 

Similarly, both countries have high population densities, especially in urban areas. Bangladesh’s capital, Dhaka, is the most densely populated city in the world.

The combination of densely populated cities with workers who cannot work from home and a new variant could be just as, if not more deadly, than it has been in India. 

The final parallel in both countries’ vulnerabilities is in healthcare infrastructure. India spends 1.28 percent of GDP on healthcare, and Bangladesh ranks similarly low at 2.38 percent. The shortage of medical oxygen could be even more acute in Bangladesh given that it imports from India for a major portion of its oxygen supply. 

What’s more, Bangladesh is heading into monsoon season, where 80 percent of the year’s rainfall occurs in approximately two months. This could result in a double-headed public health catastrophe in a country that is uniquely susceptible to natural disasters like floods. 

So far Bangladesh has fared well dealing with the Covid-19 crisis with a very rudimentary health infrastructure, supported by its massive digitisation and innovative interventions from government platforms such as the Access to Information Programme (a2i). 

But the vaccination shortage is a problem that needs global support. 

This is not just Bangladesh’s problem, it’s the world's problem, as we have learned repeatedly throughout the pandemic. Just as the Indian variant is threatening the prospects of re-opening the economy in the UK, a similarly deadly mutation could just as easily pop up in Bangladesh.

The UK and the US have vaccines to spare - and they should share them. According to current predictions, the US will be sitting on between 500 million and 1 billion surplus vaccines by September. The UK similarly is on track to have a surplus of 100 million vaccines, and has already vaccinated over 50 percent of its population. In order to distribute a second dose to those due one, Bangladesh needs only 1.6 million doses.

Bangladesh has a population of 163 million, meaning there are 163 million chances for the virus to mutate. If countries like the US and the UK do not channel surplus doses to those countries who need them, the global vaccination effort - and the world’s unlocking - could be in jeopardy.",https://cdni0.trtworld.com/w1140/h490/q75/107230_coviddhaka_1623068734471.jpg,7 Jun 2021,TRT World,Bangladesh risks becoming the next India without surplus vaccines,
2022/0063,News,https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/india-china-rivalry-shifts-to-vaccine-diplomacy/2160364,"India and China may have disengaged frontline troops from their borders, putting an end to tensions in the region, but now they have shifted their rivalries to a different field – seeking political influence through vaccine diplomacy.

According to Rajaram Panda, a former senior fellow at India's premier think-tank Institute of Defense Studies and Analysis (IDSA), the COVID-19 vaccine has emerged as an important form of diplomatic currency globally for the nations to showcase their soft power gains.

Since India produces 60% of global vaccines, it is trying to match China to use it as a diplomatic tool to expand influence in the neighborhood and beyond.

Seeking to steal a march over rival Asian giant China, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been distributing millions of doses of the locally produced AstraZeneca PLC vaccine to various countries. However, its domestic immunization program is at the bottom of the global table.

India has so far sent 36 million doses of vaccines to countries such as Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan, the Maldives, Mauritius, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Bahrain, Oman, Afghanistan, Barbados, and the Dominican Republic.

According to External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava, 6 million doses of vaccines have been supplied as aid, 29.4 million have been dispatched on a commercial basis.

""The supply of vaccines to countries will continue in the coming weeks and months in a phased manner, but it will be ensured that domestic requirements for the national vaccination program are kept in mind,"" said Srivastava.

One of India's largest donations was to neighboring Nepal, with whom its diplomatic relationship had been at a historic low.

India has also offered vaccines to all members of the diplomatic corps and their families based in the country.

""It has been offered not only to the diplomats of countries but also to those of UN agencies and intergovernmental organizations working in India. This drive will cover all the locations where they are based,"" said Srivastava.

China shipping vaccines

On the other hand, over the past month, Beijing has been shipping more than 1 million doses a week across Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. It has provided 10 million vaccine doses to developing nations through the WHO's global COVAX initiative.

India has also pledged 200 million doses for this global initiative, aiming to ensure vaccines for the 92 low- and middle-income countries.

In a written statement issued by its Foreign Ministry, China is working to provide vaccines to more than 60 countries and that more than 20 are already using them. In Africa, China has provided shots to Equatorial Guinea, Zimbabwe, and Sierra Leone and has plans to provide for an additional 16 countries on the continent.

Both these Asian countries have stepped in and found a chance to bolster their global image when the richer nations like the US have withdrawn.

Participating in an online discussion organized by the Stimson Center, Yanzhong Huang, professor, and director of the Center for Global Health Studies at the US-based Seton Hall University said China had sent 62% of its global vaccine supply to the Southeast Asian region so far, which also highlights its priority region.

Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Cambodia, and Bruni have received over 2 million doses as donations.

Others like Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore have purchased vaccines from Beijing. Besides receiving the donation, the Philippines has also signed a commercial pact to purchase shots from China.

""They want to project themselves as soft power and want to show that they are ready to fill the void left by the US in terms of global leadership,"" he said, adding that it has also come to an opportunity for Beijing to showcase its technological powers.

Even as the efficacy of the Chinese vaccine may remain questioned, its manufacturers are already making profits. Huang said Indonesia is purchasing a single dose at $25, Ukraine at $17.5, Brazil at $10, and Turkey at $13, which accounts for profits worth more than $3 billion.

Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech has licensed Indonesia's state-owned enterprise PT Bio Farma to produce 2.5 million doses per month.

Robert O. Blake, former US ambassador to Indonesia, said Chinese willingness to share licensing, which Western companies will never do, is significant.

Chinese focus on Southeast Asia

Regarding Chinese focus to Southeast Asia, Huang said the aim is to soften the stand of these countries on territorial and maritime disputes and to cement economic ties to facilitate its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) – the global infrastructure development strategy adopted by the Chinese government.

In this region in recent years, China has been assertive in consolidating jurisdictional claims, expanding the military reach, and rejecting claims by other states through coercive diplomacy. In response, the US, which had virtually withdrawn from the region soon after President Donald Trump took office, is again cobbling up allies and reviving the policy of containing and responding to Chinese claims.

While India and China don't seem to have made any immediate progress on using vaccine diplomacy to settle political objectives, they have addressed vaccine availability issues globally.

Otherwise, rich nations representing just 14% of the world's population had bought up more than half 53% of all the most promising vaccines. According to research conducted by the Duke Global Health Innovation Center, high-income countries currently hold confirmed 4.2 billion doses, while low-middle-income nations hold just 670 million doses of vaccines.

But experts believe that while the Chinese have a competitive edge on logistics, storage, or transportation, the lack of transparency and low efficacy of Sinovac has implications. ""A vaccine efficiency below 80% means that the whole population needs to be inoculated to stamp out pandemic, which looks an impossible task,"" said the professor.

India's neighborhood focus

The Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine factory, churns out the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine at a daily rate of about 2.5 million doses. That pace has allowed India to ship doses to even far-off places like Brazil and Morocco.

Sri Lanka, where both India and China are vying for a foothold, has received doses from both countries. Soon after Indian External Affairs Minister Subramanyam Jaishankar's visit to Colombo last month, the island nation received 500,000 doses from New Delhi.

According to the country's Health Ministry, the country has also placed a purchase order of 18 million doses with India's Serum Institute.

But within days, Sri Lanka also received a gift of 300,000 doses from China to combat the pandemic.

While visiting the Maldives, another island nation in the Indian Ocean, Jaishankar carried 100,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine and handed it over to his counterpart Abdulla Shahid. This was in addition to the 100,000 doses that India had already sent in January.

India has also donated 6.47 million doses to Southeast Asian countries to compete with China, including 1.5 million doses to Myanmar and 100,000 doses to Cambodia.

India is also supplying to Mongolia, and the Philippines has also signed up for procurement of 30 million doses from New Delhi, which it may receive by the second half of 2021, according to Akriti Vasudeva, a research analyst at the Stimson Center's South Asia Program.

Over the past few years, she said, India has made security and growth for all in the region (SAGAR) as part of its foreign policy doctrine to promote maritime cooperation in the Indian Ocean region.

US withdrawal creates void

""India in the past had always found it difficult to compete with China in huge infrastructure development projects and investments because of its resource constraints. But its vaccine manufacturing capacity has the potential to compete with China and claim global leadership,"" said Vasudeva.

Former US diplomat Blake said while his country had made quite clear that it will not produce the vaccine for the world because of its domestic requirements, India has taken a unique position despite having the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases.

According to the US-based Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, India has reported 11 million COVID-19 cases with 156,938 deaths. It has so far administered 13.7 million doses, fully inoculating 2.2 million people, just 0.16% of its population. Although the virus originated in China, the country has reported 100,885 cases with 4,834 deaths and has administered 40.5 million doses to its 3% population.

While Vasudeva said distributing vaccines to foreign countries is seen as a moment of triumph and a display of soft power back in India, others caution that New Delhi is walking on a razor's edge.

""This generosity [vaccine diplomacy] has deprived many Indians vaccine doses as some 17,000 people still get sick every day and over 100 people die daily from COVID-19. Being generous is one thing, but doing so at the cost of Indian lives and suffering is quite another,"" said Manoj Joshi, a strategic expert and distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation (ORF).

But all experts agree that that the COVID-19 pandemic is a turning point in history that has ended the US monopoly on technology and global leadership. While there is a recognition that China has filled up the vacuum left behind by the US, there are apprehensions that it may soon use its soft power diplomacy to shape a new geopolitical world order to meet its interests.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2021/03/01/thumbs_b_c_e9febb67f3f3fed141d32ff3e535790b.jpg?v=111024,"

There is no way that India can honour its commitment to provide vaccines when the country is facing an unprecedented health emergency with the essential supply of oxygen, drugs, hospital beds running out.

All the drum beating about Vaccine Maitri appear hollow when the government is not in a position to deliver health care to its own people. This is not questioning the export of vaccines, but questioning the Modi government’s complete mismanagement of the health crisis. Managing the health emergency is the principal task of every government. It is not just vaccinating the people, it is about stepping up domestic supply lines of ventilators, adequate stock of oxygen and ensuring distribution across the hard-hit states. Smaller countries like South Korea and Taiwan have managed the pandemic with rare efficiency, despite not having the advantage India has of being the pharmacy of the world. After the first wave, India seemed to have forgotten about the pandemic, though several countries in Europe were going through a second surge.  

Recently, foreign minister S. Jaishankar speaking at an event, took on the critics of the government’s vaccine diplomacy. “As a foreign minister, I'm pushing other countries, particularly some big countries, saying - look, please keep the raw materials flowing for vaccines to be made in India,” news agency ANI quoted Jaishankar as saying at a conclave.

“If you ask why are you exporting (vaccines) at all, somebody will ask - why am I exporting to India. That is so short-sighted. Only non-serious, irresponsible people can make that argument,” he added, according to ANI.

But no one is questioning exports. The point is the Modi government was narrowly focused on winning brownie points on the world stage through its generous sharing of the vaccine. While going ahead with this, the Centre was supposed to keep an eye on what was happening across the world and prepare for the second wave.

Vaccine diplomacy was a good move to boost India’s international image and spread goodwill by coming to the aid of humanity. India had come in for fulsome praise across the globe for its desire to help the world. The World Health Organisation had on several occasions commended India for its desire to act as a responsible global power.

India’s generosity was in sharp contrast to the vaccine nationalism of the rich industrialised world. The US, Britain, Canada and other well-to-do countries were buying vaccines much above their requirements and depriving poorer nations, especially countries in Africa. The rich nations have grabbed 60 per cent of the vaccines, while they constitute just 16 per cent of the global population.

India began its Covid outreach even before the vaccines were in place. India sent out 446 million HQC tablets and 1.54 billion paracetamol tables to 133 countries according to a press release issued at that time. Besides hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, the drug used for Covid treatment, as well as diagnostic kits, ventilators, masks, gloves, and other medical supplies were also exported.

Planning for the soft power outreach was meticulous. India first provided vaccine doses to its neighbours starting with Bangladesh and Nepal. So far, 66 million doses of Covaxin and Covishield were sent out to various countries. But exports of the vaccine have come to a halt since last month.

A country like Bangladesh is in a spot having relied heavily on Indian vaccines. India had at the start donated three million doses of the AstraZeneca to Dhaka. Bangladesh had also signed a commercial deal with Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) in 2020 to buy 30 million doses of the vaccine. Under the terms of the contract, Dhaka was to receive five million doses of Covishield vaccine per month, from January to June of this year.  

However, SII could provide just seven million doses in the first two months. India stopped exports of vaccines last month because of a fresh surge of the pandemic. Bangladesh is scrambling to get sufficient quantities of vaccine. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has spoken to her counterpart when Modi was in Dhaka last month. Bangladesh will be looking towards China and Russia if the SII is not able to honour its commitment.

All is however not lost for India. The Modi government has to concentrate on getting its act together and work at coordinating efforts to streamline the distribution of oxygen, ramp up production of essential medicines needed for Covid treatment and demonstrate that it can provide effective leadership at a time of unprecedented health crisis.",https://imgnew.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/articles/2021/4/22/vacc.jpg,,,,
2022/0066,News,https://www.eureporter.co/world/bangladesh/2022/03/17/eib-luxembourg-and-bangladesh-join-forces-to-combat-coronavirus-and-boost-country-wide-covid-19-immunization-in-bangladesh/,"The European Investment Bank (EIB), the bank of the European Union and the largest multilateral lender in the world, will provide €250 million to the People’s Republic of Bangladesh via EIB Global to support procurement of safe and effective vaccines and country-wide immunisation against COVID-19. Vaccination efforts will also include Rohingya refugees from Myanmar currently hosted in Bangladesh.

The financing will help Bangladesh to mitigate the health effects of the coronavirus pandemic and enable the country to strengthen its healthcare system and protect its people from COVID-19 with effective vaccines. These are all key preconditions for continued sustainable economic and social growth.

Luxembourg supports the development of Bangladesh’s health system since many years by financing the Non-Governmental Organisation like Friendship which operates medical stations across the country and supports Bangladesh in its vaccination campaign. Friendship is particularly engaged in the Jamuna/ Brahmaputra river area in the North of Bangladesh and in the costal belt in the South. The organisation promotes vaccination through an information and awareness campaign and provides logistical support in its roll-out, such as the registration of patients and the assistance in their transportation to vaccination centers.

EIB President Werner Hoyer said: “We very much welcome this partnership and the real impact it’s having on people’s lives. This is the perfect example of partnerships that EIB Global is increasingly promoting around the world to make a difference where is most needed. Working with other EU organisations, countries, and partners as part of Team Europe increases our impact on the ground especially when it comes to global challenges like the COVID pandemic, climate change or food security.”

Vice-President Christian Kettel Thomsen, who is responsible for operations in South Asia, said: “We are proud of the role and contribution of the EIB, the European Union, Luxembourg, and Bangladesh towards ensuring friendship, cooperation and sustainable development remain our reality. Investing in the health sector and in Covid-19 related projects has been a crucial part of EIB’s support to combat the crisis, both inside and outside the EU.”

The Ambassador of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh to the European Union, H.E. Mahbub Hassan Saleh, said: “The EIB’s loan to the Government of Bangladesh for procuring COVID-19 vaccines is the biggest and most significant development in the 22-year long journey of the Bangladesh-EIB partnership. The footprint of the EIB in Bangladesh is becoming larger and expanding into new areas, which would continue in the days ahead and contribute to greater socioeconomic development in the country. Climate change, infrastructure and renewable energy are some key areas of importance to Bangladesh and the European Union, where the EIB’s involvement can be robust in the coming days.”

Luxembourg’s Minister for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Affairs, Franz Fayot, said: “The Luxembourg Development Cooperation has been supporting NGOs active in Bangladesh for years and can look back on a particularly good and successful cooperation. With Friendship Luxembourg, for example, we work to strengthen marginalized communities in Bangladesh by improving their access to quality basic social services, such as health, sanitation and education. The importance of strengthening and stabilising health systems, and doing so on a global scale, was made particularly clear to all of us by the COVID-19 pandemic. Luxembourg will therefore continue its engagement, together with civil society, bilateral and multilateral partners, in supporting the most vulnerable, in Bangladesh and in its other partner countries.”

Friendship Bangladesh Founder and Executive Director Runa Khan said: “The COVID-19 pandemic has shown all of us how fragile and interconnected our world is and that only through solidarity we will find solutions which can bring safety for all of us. With our programmes and actions in Bangladesh throughout the last two years, and with the support of the Government of Bangladesh, the Government of Luxembourg and our partners and friends throughout Europe, we are able to support  the people of Bangladesh in the field and on the ground and share the faith and hope with them that our actions will make a difference to the lives of the people we serve.”

Friendship Luxembourg Chairman Marc Elvinger said: “We are impressed by the overall vaccination rate that Bangladesh achieved within a relatively limited period of time. With the support of Luxembourg’s Government and citizens, Friendship is able to contribute to ensuring effective access of people in rural areas of Bangladesh to vaccination and achieve vaccination rates in remote communities that are aligned with those of the rest of the country.”

2022/0067,Article,https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-how-to-eradicate-vaxtortion-ahead-of-the-next-pandemic-103730,"From monkeypox to the Marburg virus, myriad potential public health emergencies lurk behind COVID-19’s enduring grasp. The current COVID-19 pandemic is far from over but many of its legacies are already plain. For one thing, the greenlighting of new jabs is only half the story when it comes to mitigating potential suffering equitably as new crises take hold.Marburg — characterized by a severe hemorrhagic fever — surfaced in July as the latest virus to watch after initial deaths were reported in Ghana. International alarm had already coalesced around monkeypox, a zoonosis with symptoms similar to smallpox. With over 22,000 cases confirmed, the World Health Organization has now declared it a global emergency.

No vaccines are available at a global scale for either. While rightly desired, it is hoped that the last three years have taught policymakers that securing sufficiently wide protection from disease is not accomplished purely in the laboratory.

Representatives from WHO member states met last month to begin a two-year drafting process for a new global agreement on how to prepare for future pandemics. Whoever holds the pen in follow-up summits would do well to take heed of the ongoing “vaxtortion” — corruption-related barriers to health care — now being documented in many of the world’s low-income nations.

We believe harmful “vaccine apartheid” could be avoided in future pandemics through the establishment of a WHO medicine pricing database.

—
The slow rate of vaccine distribution to lower-income nations throughout the pandemic is well known and justly lamented. Less discussed has been vaxtortion, which impacts ordinary citizens around the world, entrenching poverty and inequity — both between and within countries — and compromising health outcomes.

Take Uganda as one example. Recent research undertaken by Transparency International found that almost 1 in 10 Ugandans had paid bribes to access COVID-19 vaccines. Meanwhile more than 1 in 5 reported leaning on personal connections to get their jabs.

The sums changing hands between patient and practitioner have not been trivial. Of the health facilities we examined in the East African nation, even at the center where the monetary value was the lowest, the amount needed for a bribe for a full course of COVID-19 vaccination was potentially devastating. The $1.80 charged equates to 95% of the money earned per day by those living on the national poverty line, which is $1.90 per person per day, according to data published by Development Initiatives.

Whistleblowing hotlines in Uganda have exposed cases of patients being asked to pay unexpected fees. The justification given has been that the money would be spent on advertising to promote further vaccine takeup. Evidence we gathered around the soliciting of vaccine certificates for cash indicated a road remains to be traveled in overcoming vaccine hesitancy across contexts, however. Bribes for certificates were also reported in Bangladesh, another country we looked at.While bribery to jump the queue has a direct impact on equity, providing certificates without vaccination inevitably has deeper public health implications. In an era when the United Nations member states are targeting universal health coverage by 2030, of the $8.5 trillion spent on health services globally, almost 7% is lost to corruption. This translates to over $500 billion lost annually, which is more than enough to achieve health care for all — the funding gap is currently at around $370 billion.

This truth should focus minds as WHO develops the wording of its “Pandemic prevention, preparedness and response accord,” an agreement-in-the-making that it is already calling “historic.”

The accord may well earn historic status when its final drafting concludes in 2024, but only if the foundations of anti-corrupt practice are embedded within the document — namely transparency and accountability.

Reflecting on the insights established by whistleblowing hotlines during COVID-19, the new accord must commit to empowering independent civil society organizations to support the monitoring of health emergency responses. This must apply at the global, regional, national, and subnational levels. Mechanisms must be put in place which safeguard a minimum threshold of involvement of CSOs in all countries.

It's also essential that best practice around transparency is applied earlier in the development, sale, and distribution of vaccines and other medical products. Doing this will prevent a similar situation as when South Africa was forced to pay more than double the European Union price for Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine doses.

We believe harmful “vaccine apartheid” could be avoided in future pandemics through the establishment of a WHO medicine pricing database.

The COVAX approach — a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines — should also be expanded in preparation for future pandemics, specifically through developing global or regional pooled procurement mechanisms for equipment and medicine.

Governments spend over $11 trillion or 12% of global gross domestic product on public procurement every year.

Contracts and pricing agreements between governments and pharmaceutical companies often remain confidential, despite the drugs being paid for with taxpayers’ money. Opaque contracts that keep the price and terms of vaccine purchases secret can hide corruption risks such as conflicts of interest.

People have the right to health and the right to obtain information, including that surrounding the vaccines they receive. Today we need a pandemic treaty to be drafted that upholds these human rights.

2022/0068,Podcast,https://www.artofcitizenry.com/podcast/episode-13-vaccine-apartheid,"People Over Patents: Unpacking the Vaccine Apartheid
While India is officially logging well over 350,000 COVID-19 cases per day, the number of deaths are being grossly underreported. Access to care is a privilege in a country grappling with fascism. To fully understand the situation unraveling in India and across the Global South, we must understand the ways in which neocolonialism and capitalism intersect and further the very inequities that leave communities of color being exploited by our global system. In Episode 13 of Art of Citizenry Podcast, Manpreet Kaur Kalra is joined by Anna Canning of Fair World Project for a conversation deconstructing the global vaccine apartheid, racialized capitalism, and WTO’s TRIPS agreement. 

India’s COVID-19 Crisis
Every 4 minutes a person is dying in New Delhi. Across the country, India is officially logging well over 350,000 cases per day. Deaths are going grossly underreported. Causes of death are being intentionally mislabeled to create the impression that the COVID death rate isn’t as bad as it really is. Officially, the daily death toll is around 3000-4000 deaths per day. In a TIME article by Rana Ayyub, she cites health professionals stating that the daily death toll is likely over 10,000. ndia’s public parks are being used to cremate loved ones as crematoriums exceed capacity, with piles of bodies 10 miles long in some parts of India. Beneath this grim reality lies layers of systemic inequities that prioritize the interests of those who hold the most power over those who are forced to yield it. India’s crisis sits at the intersection of neocolonialism, capitalism and fascism, deeply rooted in a history of extraction and further compounded by various forms of systemic oppression that continue to uphold colonial legacies. 

“The crisis we see unfolding in India didn’t just happen - it's a symptom of an unjust global economy that puts profits before people every step of the way.” - Anna Canning

Since Prime Minister Modi took office in 2014, India has been in utter disarray. Marginalized populations have been the target of blatant ethnic cleansing, policy decisions have been driven by corporate interests, dissent has been silenced and punished, and extreme nationalism has continued to threaten the lives of minorities throughout the country. India has a history of human rights violations that far precede Modi’s term as prime minister. Neglect for human life is a common narrative in a country with such a dense population. To put it into perspective, India has a population of 1.38 billion despite being 1/3rd the size of the United States, which has a population of 331 million. India’s reality hits incredibly close to home for me as we navigate honest conversations with our family about mortality, vaccine misinformation, and access to care with many family members being high risk. It’s honestly hard not to be utterly frustrated at times and, at other times, just simply sad to the point that you don’t want to talk about it. 

Despite people actively dying in the thousands every day, the government fails to provide the leadership necessary to tackle this public health crisis. At the beginning of the pandemic, Modi imposed an overnight nationwide lockdown with only a few hours’ notice without consulting any public health experts. This meant millions of migrant workers from Nepal, Bangladesh and across India were left stranded hundreds of miles from their homes. Without food and shelter, many slept on the streets, risking their lives. Yet again, those most impacted by systems of oppression were hurt by political irresponsibility. During the lockdowns, instead of investing time and money into building capacity for the larger health system, Modi and his government acted as though they had “beat” COVID and that a future outbreak was impossible. So much so that the country’s coronavirus task force stopped meeting — touting around the slogan Atma Nirbhar Bharat - a self sufficient India. This falsified sense of safety, further amplified by state-controlled media outlets, led to the pendulum swinging to the opposite end of the spectrum with the country opening up as if nothing had happened. People continued to go about their daily lives, and Modi painted a narrative that made him appear as though he saved humanity — pridefully boasting about sending 55 million doses of the vaccine to 62 different countries all while only a small fraction of India’s population was vaccinated. Let’s be clear: Modi put himself, his economic interests, and his party’s political interests above the wellbeing of India’s people. This is a mass murder.

In the trenches of India’s second wave, Modi continues to prioritize politics over people. As four of the country’s states went to the polls for legislative elections, Modi threw himself into full campaign mode, attending rallies without any prospect of social distancing and with mostly unmasked supporters. He also gave the green light for a massive religious Hindu festival, Kumbh Mela, which attracts millions of pilgrims to the Ganga river every 12 years. Millions participated in this weeks-long festival, which has turned into a confirmed super spreader event. But Modi did what any politician who cares more about securing votes over public health would do, he gave his majority voter base what they wanted to secure the Hindu vote.

The economic disparity we see playing out is baked into how India operates as a country, with India’s poor continuing to suffer and the rich getting richer. Wealth disparity is a real issue and human lives are valued on the basis of the amount of money you are able to cough up. Pride is intrinsically tied to wealth because it is simply the currency used when determining the value of each human life in India. I say this as an individual living in the diaspora, fully recognizing the privilege I hold.

Despite being the world's largest producer of vaccines, India has fully vaccinated less than 2 percent of its 1.3 billion people. To understand this, we need to come to terms with the ways in which neocolonialism and capitalism continue to influence how we navigate as a global economy.  

The World Trade Organization (WTO): TRIPS Waiver
The WTO oversees trade between nations. An aspect of trade that falls under the WTO’s purview is patent protections under a legal agreement called Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights known as TRIPS, which essentially looks at and enforces patent protections. Now this is where things get a little tricky. Pharmaceutical companies have patents on the vaccines that they manufacture. Basically, think about intellectual property as a way to protect corporate power and wealth, which then further allows them to control vaccine access and production. COVID vaccines could be in production everywhere, but instead, big Pharma patents are preventing access. Now remember, this vaccine research is funded by us, the taxpayers. However the companies retain patents, which are incredibly lucrative, especially when your patent is for a vaccine that is necessary for the wellbeing of the world. In fact, Pfizer is on track to make an 80% profit margin. Talk about no risk, high reward. So, how can we talk about equity when navigating a capitalist system that is rooted in the hoarding of wealth, prioritizing profits from patents over people? The TRIPS Waiver was presented to the WTO back in October 2020. However, the US finally came out in support this week on Wednesday, May 5th, 2021. It took mass carnage before the government decided to take a stand in favor of equity and justice. While it heartens me to know progress is happening, I would be lying if I didn’t mention how disheartened I am to know that corporate profits continue to take priority over human lives. These deaths were entirely preventable, the global community was just late to respond. However, the US finally coming out in support of the TRIPS waiver is just the beginning. There is still a lack of clarity and we still need to see how negotiations play out. Katherine Tai, the US trade representative who announced the Biden administration’s stance on the waiver, stated: “These negotiations will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved.” While the WTO, countries and companies continue to negotiate, those who suffer are people, namely Black and Brown communities of the Global South. I will continue to live each day worried about the wellbeing of my cousin who is struggling to get access to a vaccine in a small town of Punjab. I will continue to worry about the wellbeing of my family and community members. All while the countries that colonized us continue to claim their position as the ultimate heroes of the story, feeding in centuries of colonial narratives that continue to dictate how we operate as a global community.

2022/0069,News,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/china-s-covid-shots-give-beijing-soft-power-lever-around-the-world,"The Covid-19 pandemic has been a devastating public-health catastrophe the world over. For China, it’s also provided an unprecedented geopolitical opportunity. After it got the outbreak under control, and with world leaders distracted by their own countries’ health struggles, it was able to use the chaos of the pandemic to step up political crackdowns in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. Other nations cried foul, but China persisted. Perhaps most important, early exports of its rapidly developed vaccines have provided Beijing with a potent diplomatic calling card in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. And as the global death toll mounts, Chinese officials get to brag about their virus-fighting success around the world even as they gain greater access and influence in far-flung capitals.

“The U.S. response to the epidemic is nothing short of a mess and total failure,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, one of the original wolf warrior diplomats, named for their confrontational stance, said last month. “In contrast, China secured major strategic outcomes in fighting the virus.”

About China, at least, he’s not wrong. So far the country has shipped about 265 million Covid vaccine doses, more than all other nations combined, with commitments to provide an impressive 440 million more, according to Airfinity Ltd., a science information and analytics company. Other leading powers haven’t kept up. President Joe Biden has vowed the U.S. will become an “arsenal for fighting Covid-19.” His administration promises to boost production of U.S. vaccines and donate 80 million doses overseas by the end of June, including 20 million authorized for U.S. use—the first time he’s shared doses he could have given to Americans. Europe has done better, exporting about 118 million domestically produced doses so far, according to Airfinity, even amid criticism for a slow start to its vaccination drive at home. India, meanwhile, had exported almost 69 million doses to nearly 100 countries until it suffered the world’s worst outbreak and halted further deliveries.China is about to get another big boost. After clearing Western-made shots, the World Health Organization recently authorized the vaccine made by China’s Sinopharm Group Co. A nod for one from Sinovac Biotech Ltd. is expected soon. This will allow Chinese shots to flow to dozens of developing nations through Covax, the global vaccine initiative, which has managed to ship only 68 million of the 2 billion doses it hopes to send out by yearend. “China is going to be a critically important partner in the long run,” says Richard Hatchett, chief executive officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, one of the groups leading Covax.

The WHO authorization, a de facto approval for regulators in poorer countries, could help unleash hundreds of millions of doses of Chinese shots. The impact of the country’s contributions will also be magnified by the absence of India, making this “the best time for China to practice vaccine diplomacy and to make more use of its first-mover advantage,” says Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations.Beijing’s vaccine diplomacy is clearly of the hardball variety. India’s desperately poor neighbors in South Asia were among those China targeted. On April 27, the same day Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi organized a virtual meeting with his counterparts in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, Minister of National Defense Wei Fenghe was in Bangladesh, pledging to enhance military cooperation. Within days, officials there gave emergency approval to the Sinopharm vaccine. Less than two weeks later, China’s ambassador to Bangladesh surprised his hosts with an unexpected warning: Any future cooperation with Australia, India, Japan, and the U.S. would inevitably damage the nation’s ties with China.

“Bangladesh, which was reliant on Indian doses, is now being subjected to pressure from China over its strategic foreign partnerships in the midst of bilateral negotiations for a large sale of urgently needed vaccines,” says Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor at the City University of Hong Kong and editor of several books on global health and foreign policy. “It would be foolish to conclude that the aid and supply of vaccines that China is now giving to Asia and the world will not translate into a long-term diplomatic advantage.”The country’s upper hand may not last. India recognizes China’s advantage, but believes it won’t be long-lasting and expects its own exports will ramp up in a few months, according to a foreign ministry official in New Delhi who asked not to be identified. Chinese diplomats’ sometimes overzealous pressure tactics could also backfire. Even Bangladesh complained about the local ambassador’s comments.

Another wild card is the reliability of Chinese shots compared with that of the other vaccines. The efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine, for instance, varies wildly—from 50% to 90%— in studies. Global surveys have shown Chinese shots are the least favored in several places. Even in Hong Kong, only 37% said they’d take a Sinovac jab, compared with 56% for Pfizer Inc.’s. Western vaccine diplomacy with more effective shots could easily push back gains by China, according to Thomas, the Hong Kong academic. The official in New Delhi says India remains a trusted partner for vaccines around the developing world and that Chinese shots haven’t lived up to expectations.Across Africa, nations have struggled with vaccine hesitancy, suggesting China’s shots may languish in storage rather than generate the political goodwill Beijing intended. “Although some of my workmates have been vaccinated, I am still afraid to do it because of what I’ve read on social media,” says Passmore Mwanza, a 29-year-old supervisor at a candy maker in Zimbabwe.

Still, China’s contributions will be crucial in the race to inoculate large populations across the developing world before outbreaks— and variants—spread too widely. With Covax shipments delayed by the India export collapse, China might be the only choice in the near term for many poorer countries. “The pandemic started as a Chernobyl moment for China,” says Suisheng Zhao, director of the University of Denver’s Center for China-U.S. Cooperation. “It has become an opportunity for China to demonstrate to the world that its rise cannot be stopped.”",https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/itEpfaKrWiyU/v2/800x-1.jpg,"May 19, 2021",Bloomberg,"China Is Winning the Race to Vaccinate the World, for Now",

There is no way that India can honour its commitment to provide vaccines when the country is facing an unprecedented health emergency with the essential supply of oxygen, drugs, hospital beds running out.

All the drum beating about Vaccine Maitri appear hollow when the government is not in a position to deliver health care to its own people. This is not questioning the export of vaccines, but questioning the Modi government’s complete mismanagement of the health crisis. Managing the health emergency is the principal task of every government. It is not just vaccinating the people, it is about stepping up domestic supply lines of ventilators, adequate stock of oxygen and ensuring distribution across the hard-hit states. Smaller countries like South Korea and Taiwan have managed the pandemic with rare efficiency, despite not having the advantage India has of being the pharmacy of the world.

The US, Britain, Canada and other well-to-do countries were buying vaccines much above their requirements and depriving poorer nations, especially countries in Africa. The rich nations have grabbed 60 per cent of the vaccines, while they constitute just 16 per cent of the global population.

India began its Covid outreach even before the vaccines were in place. India sent out 446 million HQC tablets and 1.54 billion paracetamol tables to 133 countries according to a press release issued at that time. Besides hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, the drug used for Covid treatment, as well as diagnostic kits, ventilators, masks, gloves, and other medical supplies were also exported.

Planning for the soft power outreach was meticulous. India first provided vaccine doses to its neighbours starting with Bangladesh and Nepal. So far, 66 million doses of Covaxin and Covishield were sent out to various countries. But exports of the vaccine have come to a halt since last month.

A country like Bangladesh is in a spot having relied heavily on Indian vaccines. India had at the start donated three million doses of the AstraZeneca to Dhaka. Bangladesh had also signed a commercial deal with Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) in 2020 to buy 30 million doses of the vaccine. Under the terms of the contract, Dhaka was to receive five million doses of Covishield vaccine per month, from January to June of this year.  

However, SII could provide just seven million doses in the first two months. India stopped exports of vaccines last month because of a fresh surge of the pandemic. Bangladesh is scrambling to get sufficient quantities of vaccine. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has spoken to her counterpart when Modi was in Dhaka last month. Bangladesh will be looking towards China and Russia if the SII is not able to honour its commitment.

All is however not lost for India. The Modi government has to concentrate on getting its act together and work at coordinating efforts to streamline the distribution of oxygen, ramp up production of essential medicines needed for Covid treatment and demonstrate that it can provide effective leadership at a time of unprecedented health crisis.",22 Apr 2021,Outlook India,PM Modi's Vaccine Diplomacy Goes For A Toss As India's Health System Crumbles,,
2022/0071,Article,https://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/83480,"This is the European Union’s chance. But it’s going to take some explaining to its citizens.“The virus knows no borders and has no interest in the nationality of its victims,” German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier told the World Health Summit, which took place virtually on October 25–27, 2020.

“It will overcome all barriers if we do not work together to counter it. In the face of the virus, we are without doubt a global community. But the key question is: Are we able to act like one?”

Then Steinmeier got to the nub of what is a political, social, and ethical issue. “Will political leaders manage to explain convincingly that it is advantageous for all of us if as a first step some people are vaccinated in all countries instead of all people in some countries?” he asked.

COVAX, a global collaboration co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and the World Health Organization, wants to “accelerate the development and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, and to guarantee fair and equitable access for every country in the world.” It’s about making the vaccine a global public good. This should be in Europe’s interests too.

Selling Steinmeier’s idea to a European public—he has suggested that nurses in African countries be vaccinated as a first step, and soonest—needs a big PR push.

The German taxpayers are shouldering state aid for its pharmaceutical company BioNTech, which in cooperation with Pfizer, its American partner, has started vaccinations in the United States and the United Kingdom. A German taxpayer could turn around and say, “This is our vaccine. We need it given the rising mortality and infection rate.”

And just wait until the arguments begin about which sectors or professions in EU countries should be first in line to get the jab. So far, so good: it will be healthcare workers and the most vulnerable.

There’s little doubt that most Europeans will want the vaccine as soon as possible. But the EU should also move fast to vaccinate especially doctors and nurses in as many affected and vulnerable African countries as possible. There are several compelling reasons to do this.

First is the destructive nature of the virus. The longer it flourishes, the greater the chance of it mutating in ways that make it even more deadly, contagious, or just difficult to vaccinate against. This could already be happening in Great Britain. Getting it rolled out quickly across Africa is crucial.

Second, the coronavirus pandemic is destroying the remittances that migrants based in Europe and other countries send home to their families. These remittances are often the lifeline for their siblings to get educated and for their parents to buy medicines, food, and clothes and pay the rent. Fewer remittances could spell increased poverty and instability.

A World Bank study in April showed remittance flows to sub-Saharan Africa are expected to decline by 23.1 percent to reach $37 billion (€30 billion) in 2020, down from $48 billion (€39 billion) in 2019. A recovery of only 4 percent is expected in 2021. What a setback for a region where economies were growing, and weak governance was being tackled.

Third, here is a chance for Europe’s soft power. Yes, the EU is already Africa’s biggest donor. Most of the money is channeled through its European Development Fund, of which the eleventh and current edition has a €29.1 billion budget. Most of it is for national and regional cooperation programs.

But now, distributing the coronavirus vaccine provides a unique opportunity for the EU and Africa to work together and build a relationship of optimism and trust—which is sorely needed. That trust got a battering when a planned EU–African Union summit on December 9 was postponed on very short notice. Both sides, privately, blamed each other.

Fourth, if the EU and European governments are really serious about their soft power, this is the time to share the vaccine in a way that counters the global influence of China.

China has already been sending vaccines for trials in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. In Indonesia, by the way, the country’s state-owned pharmaceutical company, after having said on December 8 that CoronaVac—a Chinese vaccine—was 97 percent effective, later that day said the efficacy of the vaccine could not yet be determined. Distrust of China’s intentions in Asia runs deep.

As for China’s relations with Africa, where it has built huge infrastructure projects on the back of loans to several countries and is extracting much-needed raw materials, the Chinese leadership has gone on the offensive.

In June, Chinese President Xi Jinping told a meeting of African leaders that “African countries will be among the first to benefit” from a coronavirus vaccine, once its development and deployment is completed in China.

Moreover, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has pledged that Beijing would extend $11 billion (€9 billion) in loans for vaccines to Latin American and Caribbean countries.

But there’s no such thing as a free Chinese vaccine there or in Africa. All the more reason for the EU to seize the opportunity to boost its soft power with a combination of philanthropy and a big dose of self-interest.

In short, this is Europe’s chance to make a difference globally—and show African countries that there is an alternative to the China model. It shouldn’t waste it.

If the prosperous, democratic, and stable EU wants to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control, it’s going to require a major, global effort to do so.

2022/0072,Article,https://www.eastmojo.com/coronavirus-updates/2021/12/11/is-omicron-a-product-of-vaccine-apartheid/,"Kuala Lumpur: The unintended consequence of vaccine apartheid has left billions of people in poor countries unvaccinated creating opportunities for COVID-19 to mutate.

Months into the pandemic, long before the development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, most industrialised countries pledged in principle to treat COVID-19 vaccines as a global public good to be made accessible and affordable to people who would need them most across the world.However, ‘vaccine nationalism’ has since become the norm.

Vaccine nationalism has seen rich countries with less than 20 percent of the world’s population stockpiling 60 percent of the world’s vaccine supply, aiming to first exclusively vaccinate 70 percent of their population to achieve herd immunity.

The practice has since plunged the world into ‘vaccine apartheid’ the separation of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people in low- and middle-income countries from COVID-19 vaccine programmes.

The unintended consequence of vaccine apartheid has left billions of people in poor countries unvaccinated creating opportunities for the virus to mutate into easily transmissible vaccine-resistant variants. The recent Omicron COVID-19 variant is a case in point. Omicron, according to the World Health Organisation, is a variant of concern because it has a large number of mutations. Although officially detected in South Africa, The Netherlands later confirmed it found the Omicron variant before its detection in South Africa, indicating the variant was already in Europe before the Southern African cases.

In a swift reaction, several countries including the United States, Canada, UK, EU, and some countries in Asia imposed flight bans on Southern African countries including Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zambia, Zimbabwe and Nigeria. Such flight bans are short-term discriminatory policies that mask the larger issues of vaccine apartheid with billions of people unvaccinated and ample opportunity for mutations to occur.
Vaccine allocation must not become a zero-sum game , warns Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organisation. Vaccine nationalism is not just morally indefensible… It is epidemiologically self-defeating and clinically counterproductive .

That no one is safe, until everyone is safe is a truism that underscores the gap between the rich and poor nations in a pandemic.

Why should rich countries and powerful non-state actors like pharmaceutical corporations invest their resources to dismantle the barriers erected by vaccine apartheid in a time of COVID-19 and future pandemics?

Simply put, enlightened self-interest.

Nobel Laureate Joshua Lederberg’s wrote in his widely cited thesis, the world is just one village, and our tolerance of disease in any place in the world is at our own peril .Leave no one behind’ is not just an empty slogan or redundant rhetoric in the creed of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, but an important piece of the sustainable development puzzle.

While classic diplomacy the conduct of official relations between the governments of sovereign nations, and between governments and international organisations is often characterised by pursuit of strategic economic and security interests, divergent interests in global health favour a different diplomatic strategy.

The microbial unification of the world’ by COVID-19 and the recognition that there are no health sanctuaries anywhere is an opportunity for a new brand of health diplomacy.

Instead of overly prioritising the lives and safety of populations of industrialised countries, the global production, supply, and distribution of COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines should take into account the structural inequities in the international system between the rich and poor, developed and developed economies, and the global North and South.

COVID-19 and past pandemics have aptly demonstrated how globalisation has immersed all of humanity in a single germ pool.One of the unintended consequences being the emergence of global microbial superhighways.

As the distinction between national and international health is being altered by emerginginterdependence between nations, it is now widely accepted that pathogenic microbes do not carry national passports, nor do they recognise the sovereignty and geopolitical boundaries of countries.

In all millennia of recorded history, infectious diseases have killed more people than wars. History is replete with pandemics that decimated a significant percentage of humanity, from the Plague of Athens in 430 BC to Black Death (Bubonic Plague) in fourteenth-century Europe. Add to this smallpox, measles, scarlet fever, chicken pox, influenza in the Americas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and the global swine flu in 1918-19.

In recent decades, the outbreaks of ebola virus disease, lassa fever, hanta virus, West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the re-emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, the global pandemic of HIV/AIDS, COVID-19 and other diseases that transcend national boundaries has re-positioned all of humanity for a decisive germ battle with microbial forces.

Enlightened self-interest compels all countries to stop vaccine apartheid and rebuild trust in global health, realising that threats to health anywhere are threats to health everywhere. (360info.org)

Rolando Pérez Rodríguez, Director of Science and Innovation, BioCubaFarma; Olga Lidia Jacobo-Casanueva, Director, Center for State Control of Medicines and Medical Devices (CECMED); Ileana Morales Suárez, Director of Science and Technology Innovation, Ministry of Public Health, Cuba and Coordinator of the national vaccination plan for Covid-19 addressed and took questions from journalists, vaccine manufacturers, public health experts and political representatives from other countries. 

Despite the US embargo, Cuba has received funding from The Central American Bank for Economic Integration, which, according to Reuters, is sufficient to produce the 200 million doses. Yesterday (Monday 24 January) at a press briefing in Havana, Dr Vicente Vérez Bencomo, Director General of the Finley Institute of Vaccines said, “they could produce 120 million doses in one year alone.”

At the briefing, the Cuban government announced its plan to get these doses into the arms of those who need them in the Global South, including:

Solidarity prices for Covid-19 vaccines for low-income countries;
Technology transfer where possible for production in low-income countries; 
Extending medical brigades to build medical capacity and training for vaccine distribution in partner countries. 
The briefing was organised by Progressive International in response to what the World Health Organization (WHO) called a “tsunami” of new Covid-19 cases crashing over the world at the beginning of 2022, a record number since the pandemic began in 2020, amid a situation that WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Gheybreysus described as “vaccine apartheid”. The impact of Covid-19 has been violently unequal: 80 percent of adults in the EU are fully vaccinated, but only 9.5 percent of people in low-income countries have received a single dose of the vaccine.

1. Solidarity prices for Covid-19 vaccines for low-income countries:
Cuba has already vaccinated its own population, with more than 90 percent receiving at least one dose of homegrown vaccine. 
Price inequities have plagued the Covid-19 vaccine landscape. World Health Organisation (WHO) data analysed by The Independent shows that governments of lower-income countries are paying a median price of $6.88 (£5.12) per dose for Covid vaccines. Before the pandemic, developing countries paid a median price of $0.80 a dose for non-Covid jabs, WHO figures show. South Africa has been forced to buy doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine at a price 2.5 times higher than that paid by most European countries. Bangladesh and Uganda have also paid more than the EU for the vaccine.
COVAX, the global vaccine procurement initiative meant to ensure a subsidised supply of vaccines to poorer countries has repeatedly fallen short of its goals and in September 2021, announced a 25 percent reduction in its expected vaccine supply for 2021.
Cuba has sent donations to countries that requested assistance with Covid-19 vaccines, including recently, to Syria and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. In addition, it has exported doses and negotiated tech-transfer deals with other countries including Argentina, Iran, Venezuela, Vietnam and Nicaragua.
2. Technology transfer where possible for production in low-income countries: Cuba is in conversations with more than 15 countries regarding production in their countries. 
Cuba’s vaccines use a protein sub-unit technology platform, based on protein antigens, which makes them easy to produce at scale and simple to store, as they do not require freezing temperatures. 
Cuba’s offer is likely to find many interested buyers, many of whom have been turned away by big pharmaceutical companies. John Fulton, spokesperson for Canadian manufacturer Biolyse said, ""I am interested in this showcase because Cuba presents a unique model of vaccine internationalism. Looking forward to hearing what opportunities may exist in regards to tech transfer for the production of COVID-19 vaccines for lower-income nations."" Biolyse has attempted to seek a compulsory licence through Canada’s Access to Medicines Regime specifically for the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen vaccine.
Last month, experts identified more than 100 companies in Africa, Asia, and Latin America with the potential to produce mRNA vaccines, urging the governments of US and Germany to compel their pharmaceutical companies to share technology. However, no progress has been made and at the beginning of the year, the World Health Organization lamented the fact that “lack of sharing of licences, technology and know-how by pharmaceutical companies meant manufacturing capacity went unused.”
BioCubaFarma, the Cuban state-run biotechnology organisation has been in close contact with representatives at the WHO in order to obtain a prequalification status for its Covid19 vaccines, which they hope to do in 2022. A complete dossier of data is scheduled to be delivered to the WHO by the beginning of February. In addition, Cuba plans to work with the national regulatory agencies of all the countries interested in acquiring the Cuban vaccines.
3. Extending medical brigades to build medical capacity and training for vaccine distribution in partner countries:
Cuba plans to send its Henry Reeve Brigades to countries in need of support with vaccine distribution, both for immediate deployment and longer term training of personnel.
Disparities in the ability to distribute vaccines are hindering governments’ abilities to ensure a speedy rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in many low-income countries. According to the international humanitarian organisation CARE, the cost for vaccine rollouts in developing countries has been vastly under-calculated by international donors leading to many donated doses lying around waiting to get into arms. Kate O’Brien, the WHO’s vaccine director, reportedly said that funding for distribution “is absolutely an issue that we’re experiencing and hearing about from countries.” 
Cuba has a successful history of this approach: In 2014 and 2015, Cuban medics worked against Ebola in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, reducing the morality rates of their patients from 50 to 20 per cent and introduced a preventative education programme to stop the disease spreading. By January 2015, Cuba had trained over 13,000 people to deal with Ebola in 28 African countries, plus 68,000 people in Latin America and 628 in the Caribbean. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, some 40 countries across five continents have received Cuban medics.
The offer of technical assistance holds great promise for developing countries as many have shifted focus to building robust domestic biotech industries. At the Progressive International Summit, Anyang’ Nyong’o, Governor of Kenya’s Kisumu County, invited Cuba “to come to Kenya to share technology and expand production of the vaccine candidates you are developing.”
The briefing follows the Progressive International’s four-day Summit for Vaccine Internationalism held in June 2021 which hailed a “new international health order” and saw participation from the national governments of Argentina, Mexico, Bolivia, Cuba and Venezuela as well as the regional governments of Kisumu, Kenya and Kerala, India alongside political leaders from 20 countries.

At today’s briefing, responding to expressions on interest in Cuba’s vaccines, Rolando Pérez Rodríguez, Director of Science and Innovation, BioCubaFarma, said:
“Cuba is open to any proposal that implies a greater impact of our vaccines in the world.""

David Adler, general coordinator of the Progressive International and head of its delegation to Cuba, said:
“Today’s announcements by Cuban scientists should mark an historic turning point in the history of the Covid-19 pandemic. This lifesaving package sets the standard for vaccine internationalism and a pathway to a New International Health Order, where public health and science are placed above private profit and petty nationalism.”

2022/0074,Press Release,https://reliefweb.int/report/world/persistent-covid-19-vaccine-inequity-has-significant-implications-refugees-and-other,"Globally, access to COVID-19 vaccines has been uneven. More than one year since vaccines became widely available in high-income Western countries, many lower-income countries have struggled with supply and have notably low rates of vaccination. With each new wave and each new variant, this gap has widened. As of April 2022, approximately 65 percent of the world’s population had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine; among low-income countries the rate averaged 15 percent. In fact, as of February 2022, more booster shots had been administered in wealthy countries than total doses in low-income countries.

This disparity has particularly acute consequences for the world’s 26.6 million refugees, 85 percent of whom live in developing nations. On paper, many of these refugees and other internationally displaced people have long had access to the vaccine. As of June 2021, 98 percent of the 126 countries hosting at least 500 refugees had planned to include them in vaccine distribution, in commitments made either through formal vaccination plans or to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). But while there appears to be will from many national governments to extend vaccines to refugees, a gap remains in individuals’ ability to actually access them.

Largely, refugees are in countries with underfunded public institutions, meaning that even in the best of times their access to essential services is limited. In many countries, refugees’ lack of identity documents represents a barrier to health-care access, as does the large numbers of individuals who might qualify as refugees but have not applied for protection or who for other reasons lack status. In major refugee-hosting countries such as Iran and Pakistan, vulnerable individuals have been estimated to number in the millions, but their lack of legal status leaves then excluded from formal vaccination schemes. People who have fled war but are unauthorized in their new countries might also distrust authorities or have legitimate fears of being targeted for arrest or deportation, which can prevent them from seeking vaccination. Governments have also shown a preference for prioritizing populations such as the native born and have targeted them for vaccine outreach, with the result that vaccine sites are placed far from where refugees live. Meanwhile UNHCR, which is responsible for vaccinating many refugees, has reported severe underfunding. In September 2021, the agency reported having only one-third the budget it predicted it would need to respond to the COVID-19 crisis, with a shortfall of nearly U.S. $617 million.

Yet at root, the global inequity of vaccine distribution is to blame. The Gavi-led COVAX initiative responsible for distributing vaccines to all countries irrespective of their wealth had initially promised to ship more than 2 billion doses by the end of 2021. It missed this target by a wide margin. As of April 2022, the initiative had shipped slightly more than 1.4 billion doses to 145 countries, 90 percent of which were lower income. High-income countries in North America and Europe, where leading vaccines were developed, were quick to reserve the output for their residents, while COVAX was slower to secure financing and supply. Even developing countries with vaccine production capacity, such as India, placed restrictions on exports as they responded to new domestic outbreaks. Among the top refugee-hosting countries, rates of vaccination for the overall population range widely, from 77 percent in Germany to just 13 percent in Sudan.

All the while, economic and social repercussions of the pandemic have meant that many refugees are now more vulnerable than before the global health crisis started. Many have lost jobs or had their employment opportunities drastically reduced, leading to difficulties in securing basic needs. Furthermore, pressure on hospitals has meant that forcibly displaced migrants are less able to access not only COVID-19 related health-care services, but also treatments for other medical needs. Twenty-two percent of the world’s refugee population lives in camp settings where social distancing is virtually impossible; even though officials’ worst fears about outbreaks in these locations have not been realized, many watchers have remained concerned about the prospect of continued spread. And migrants of all kinds have been easy scapegoats, accused of spreading the COVID-19 virus—further marginalizing people forced to flee conflicts or disaster.

With the pandemic now in its third year, societies are developing new ways of coping. But the global recovery is marred by unequal vaccine access. This article examines the persistent disparity in access to vaccination against COVID-19 for refugees and other forcibly displaced people in Asia and Africa. Given the global nature of the virus and the fact that variants that emerge among small populations can spread worldwide, inequities have consequences not only for vulnerable individuals but the planet as a whole.

In Asia, Large Unregistered Population Has Been Left Out

According to UNHCR, every government in the Asia-Pacific region has either explicitly included refugees in its vaccine campaign or has provided country-level assurances of its intention to vaccinate refugees. However, many countries have not signed the 1951 Refugee Convention and lack formal refugee frameworks, leaving large numbers of individuals without access to services. Vaccination rates remain uneven, and many forcibly displaced people have found themselves on the sidelines.

Pakistan and Iran Face Challenges with Unregistered Afghan Populations

Pakistan hosts 1.4 million Afghan refugees according to official records, plus as many as 2 million more unregistered migrants from Afghanistan and smaller numbers from Bangladesh, Myanmar, and the Chinese region of Tibet. Registered refugees have been formally included in the government’s vaccination program, and 59 percent of the country’s population has received at least one dose (there are no publicly available statistics about refugees’ vaccination rates).

However, the large population of unregistered Afghans and others without formal papers—including many Pakistani natives who live in rural areas—has been unable to take advantage of the vaccination program. Some migrants have also expressed skepticism about the origins of the pandemic and may be reluctant to seek out a vaccine. Many have said that they have not been approached as part of government or nongovernmental vaccination campaigns.

Following the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan last year, approximately 300,000 Afghans arrived in Pakistan seeking safety, according to government officials, about two-thirds entering without authorization. Pakistan’s government announced it would provide vaccines to new entrants from Afghanistan at border crossings, however the country was generally resistant to welcome the new arrivals and it is unclear how many jabs were put into arms.

Iran, the other major destination for people forcibly displaced from Afghanistan, hosted an estimated 3.6 million refugees and other vulnerable migrants as of 2021. Of these, however, nearly 2.3 million lacked legal status. The country has reportedly been hard hit by the pandemic, and also limited its public-health response by refusing to accept vaccines produced in the United States or United Kingdom. According to UNHCR, nearly 500,000 foreign nationals—including refugees and Afghans without legal status—had been vaccinated as of November, which would amount to approximately 14 percent of the total. By contrast, 67 percent of the total Iranian population had received at least one dose at that time.

In Bangladesh, Slow Rollout for Rohingya Refugees

Bangladesh hosts nearly 900,000 refugees from Myanmar, most of them ethnic Rohingya who since 2012 have fled the military-led crackdown in their native Rakhine state. Living in camps, which are heavily manned by security forces and with little access to the outside world, these refugees have long struggled to access health care. Longstanding health-care challenges became more acute with the onset of the pandemic.

Bangladesh witnessed a dramatic surge in COVID-19 cases in 2021, but the government included refugees in its vaccination drive only that August. By February, about 307,000 had received their first shot, including about 5,800 of the 18,000 refugees on the cyclone-prone island of Bhasan Char, where the government has been encouraging many Rohingya to relocate (reportedly moving some against their will). These numbers are notably smaller than the 57 percent of the country as a whole that had received a jab as of that period. Although the country’s immunization drive continues, it remains slow, predominantly due to the lack of available vaccines.

India Contends with High Caseloads

India has recorded the second highest number of total confirmed COVID-19 cases globally and the third most confirmed deaths, although the actual numbers are estimated to be much higher. Seventy-two percent of Indians had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as of April, and in January officials began distributing booster shots to priority groups such as frontline workers and certain individuals over 60 years old.

India is home to more than 217,000 refugees, most of whom are from neighboring Sri Lanka and Tibet and are assisted by the government. Approximately 47,000 are under the purview of UNHCR, chiefly from Afghanistan and Myanmar (mostly of the persecuted Chin and Rohingya ethnic groups) or the Middle East and Africa. Partly because India has no formal refugee law, refugees have traditionally lived on the fringes with very limited access to health care and other essential services. When COVID-19 cases surged, access to these supports became nearly impossible. Most refugees rely on government clinics and hospitals for treatment, and their access is often facilitated by UNHCR India and its partners, however these agencies were ill equipped to deal with refugees’ needs as hospitals collapsed under the weight of high infection rates during the Delta surge around April and May 2021.

The result has been slow vaccination for refugees and other displaced people in India. As of January 2022, approximately 49,000 refugees and asylum seekers had been vaccinated, a rate of 23 percent. Yet demand for vaccines is strong: A survey by the Migration and Asylum Project (MAP) in 2021 revealed that more than 60 percent of the refugee respondents were interested in getting vaccinated, despite doubts similar to those voiced by the rest of India’s population.

Southeast Asia

Countries in Southeast Asia were generally late to extend their vaccination plans to refugees and other vulnerable migrants, and a combination of factors has contributed to a mixed uptake. In Thailand, the vaccination drive for refugees and other displaced people started only in October 2021. Aid organizations played a role in mobilizing resources and lobbying the government to offer support to vulnerable communities, however the process has been slow and vaccination numbers low, especially among the nearly 554,000 stateless people. Another issue was delays in delivering millions of doses donated by the United States to be administered by the COVAX initiative; the episode illustrates the bureaucratic hinderances that can hamper vaccine rollout. In this case, the Thai organization tasked with helping distribute the doses could not obtain the government’s permission to do so, leaving the doses and would-be recipients in limbo for several months.

In Indonesia, the 13,200 refugees registered with UNHCR—more than half of whom are from Afghanistan—have access to the private and national vaccination program, and as of January slightly more than 7,400 refugees had received at least one vaccine. Still, efforts to vaccinate refugees occurred relatively late in the year and at least initially the only refugees eligible were those in areas where at least 70 percent of the population had received a first dose; as of early November, this represented just six of the country’s 34 provinces.

The Malaysian government opened its national vaccination program to all residents irrespective of documentation, including the nearly 187,000 registered refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless individuals, the vast majority of whom are from Myanmar. Still, legal status presents a barrier to vaccination: As many as 4 million migrants lack legal status, and among this population many have expressed fear that they will be arrested and deported if they come forward. Their concerns are not without reason—the government said in early 2021 that it would not make immigration-related arrests for anyone seeking COVID-19 testing or treatment, but reversed the decision a few months later and arrested more than 2,000 people.

Sub-Saharan Africa: Paltry Access to Vaccination Regardless of Status

By and large, the countries with the lowest vaccination rates are in sub-Saharan Africa. Many African countries rely on the COVAX initiative run by Gavi, which is a public-private global health partnership seeking to increase access to immunizations in lower-income countries. As a result, they have been especially affected by the global inequitable vaccine distribution. Continent-wide, just 21 percent of Africans had received even a first dose as of April 2022. Yet short supply is not the only challenge; governments have struggled to administer available doses because of supply chain limitations and other issues. For instance, officials in South Sudan have faced challenges distributing vaccines because of lack of road connectivity. Elsewhere, individuals’ lack of identity documents, access to the internet, technological capabilities, and awareness of COVID-19 have contributed to low rates of vaccination. Countries across the continent also contend with weak public-health systems.

Uganda, which hosts the largest refugee population in Africa (nearly 1.5 million people), has generally provided services for refugees and included them in its COVID-19 vaccination drive very early on. However, persistent administrative, logistical, and physical barriers to vaccine access have posed challenges. For instance, refugees without identification cards have had to undergo the cumbersome process of obtaining a letter from the prime minister’s office. Even if they have ID, refugees must fill out a registration form and receive a vaccination card written in English, which many refugees do not speak. At times, vaccines have only been available on certain days, and refugees have not had always reliable information about where they can be obtained. Just 8 percent of Uganda’s population had received at least a first dose as of November 2021, but among refugees the rate was less than 1 percent.

Many other countries on the continent face a similar situation. Ethiopia hosts close to 783,000 refugees and has included them in its vaccine rollout plan. But the Ethiopian government, which since late 2020 has been waging a brutal conflict in its northern Tigray region, is struggling with vaccinating its population in general, due to public hesitancy and limited supply. As of November 2021, fewer than 7,500 refugees had received a jab.

Similarly, South Africa hosts approximately 250,000 refugees and asylum seekers, but many forcibly displaced people live in unauthorized status due to legal and bureaucratic barriers. The government began including unauthorized migrants in its vaccination program only in December 2021.

Due in large part to short supply and distribution challenges, refugees in sub-Saharan Africa are nowhere close to being vaccinated on par with their counterparts in other parts of the world. Still, things are slowly changing. Since January, African countries have been able to request vaccines directly from the World Health Organization (WHO) instead of receiving vaccines as and when they became available. This new distribution model is likely to accelerate the rate of vaccination on the continent, potentially including among refugees and other vulnerable populations. A ramp-up will have to happen to meet the WHO goal of vaccinating 70 percent of the continent’s population by the middle of 2022.

New Crises Underscore Complicated Picture

More than two years of repeated COVID-19 outbreaks and variants across the world have demonstrated that any large unvaccinated population could become a breeding ground for the next mutation. Increasing access and availability of vaccines therefore has global consequences.

Just as important is the need to safeguard some of the most vulnerable populations in the world. With situations deteriorating in countries including Afghanistan, Myanmar, and Ukraine, the coming years will likely see an unprecedented number of people forced from their homes and their countries. Safeguarding refugees and other vulnerable migrants against COVID-19 will result in stronger protection regimes for the world writ large.",,19 Apr 2022,"reliefweb

2022/0075,Article,https://www.nbr.org/publication/rising-power-competition-the-covid-19-vaccine-diplomacy-of-china-and-india/,"The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted the daily life of people around the world and changed the shape of global politics. Health diplomacy, which had attracted limited attention compared to political, economic, and military diplomacy, has gained new importance over the last year. Unlike during previous crises, however, rising powers are playing increasingly central roles in health diplomacy, especially in the developing world. China and India, in particular, have been proactive in using medical supplies and, more recently, vaccines to advance their diplomatic goals. This essay examines each country’s approach to vaccine diplomacy and analyzes the potential implications for the new normal in Asia.

CHINA
Being the country where the Covid-19 virus first broke out, China initiated vaccine research in January 2020, before cases appeared in many other countries. Vaccine development teams featured public-private partnerships that combined state research institutions’ resources and pharmaceutical companies’ manufacturing capabilities. These teams gained significant financial, institutional, and infrastructural assistance from the government. Four vaccines have been approved in China and at least one foreign country (BBIBP-CorV by Sinopharm and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, CoronaVac by Sinovac Biotech, Convidecia by CanSinoBIO and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and ZF2001 by Zhifei Longcom and the Chinese Academy of Sciences).

The bulk of Chinese vaccines are produced domestically. With the help of the government, manufacturers started ramping up production capacity as vaccines were being developed and tested. As early as April 2020, Sinopharm established production lines in Beijing and Wuhan with an annual capacity of 300 million doses, with plans to eventually export 300 to 500 million doses to over twenty countries. Similarly, Sinovac and CanSinoBIO increased their production to 300 million and 200 million doses, respectively. This expanded capacity allows China to meet domestic demand as well as fulfill orders from abroad.

“China categorizes its vaccines as ‘public goods’ and has…provided vaccine aid to developing countries….Yet these donations usually come later and in smaller amounts than its commercial contracts.”
With limited domestic cases for clinical trials, Chinese vaccine developers conducted stage-three trials in developing countries—not just in Asia but across Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. This strategy benefited from China’s “mask diplomacy” early on, but the main reason for these countries to host clinical trials was to secure better access to vaccines. Vaccine developers usually collaborated with local pharmaceutical companies or health departments, which helped recruit volunteers, coordinate physical and institutional resources, and conduct the trials in return for preferential pricing, delivery time, and technology transfer. If a local pharmaceutical company has hosted the clinical trial, the agreement can include conditions designating it as the in-country partner in manufacturing and distributing vaccines for domestic use and export. Nearly every country that hosted Chinese trials has ordered vaccines.

China categorizes its vaccines as “public goods” and has promised priority access to ASEAN and African countries and provided vaccine aid to developing countries. For example, in Asia, China donated 1 million doses to Cambodia and 300,000 to Myanmar and Laos, as well as batches to Brunei and Nepal, among other countries. In Africa, China has donated doses to Equatorial Guinea, Congo, and Sierra Leone, among others. In the Middle East, it has donated small amounts of vaccines to Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria. Yet these donations usually come later and in smaller amounts than its commercial contracts. For example, it donated 600,000 doses to the Philippines after the country ordered 25 million doses, 500,000 doses to Pakistan after it ordered 1.2 million doses, and 200,000 doses to Zimbabwe after it ordered 600,000 doses. While China is offering vaccine aid to 69 countries and exporting doses to 43 countries, the exported volume has been 100 times the volume of donations.

Moreover, Chinese vaccine diplomacy has been overwhelmingly bilateral to date. As China has delivered 5 million doses to 13 countries, with more on the way, its bilateral donations could exceed its contribution to COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX), a global initiative to ensure equitable access to vaccines. China initially did not agree to join COVAX, before changing its mind in October 2020. China has pledged to buy vaccines for around 1% of its population through COVAX (approximately 15 million doses) but has yet to specify how it will buy these vaccines.

A major driving factor behind the decision to join the initiative may have been economic. Although China gets more reputational boost by donating directly to developing countries of its choice, its participation in COVAX, in addition to signaling support for multilateral institutions, serves as an incentive for the World Health Organization (WHO) to approve Chinese vaccines. China will most likely choose its own brands for the vaccines it has pledged to buy. When the WHO authorizes China’s vaccines, COVAX might then order doses of these vaccines with the money contributed by industrialized countries for developing countries, which could dramatically boost China’s share in the global vaccine market.

INDIA
India is among the world’s largest pharmaceutical manufacturers, producing around 60% of the world’s vaccines by volume. It has been hard hit by the pandemic, with more than ten million infections (second only to the United States at the time of writing), and desperately needs vaccines to protect its people and economy. However, while India has developed several vaccine candidates in different stages of clinical trials, the main vaccine it uses for vaccine diplomacy is Covishield, the adapted version of the British vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. The Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, signed a deal in April 2020 to produce 1 billion AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine doses, half for domestic use and half for other low- and middle-income countries, charging only production costs. By January 3, 2021, when India approved emergency use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, the Serum Institute had produced 40–50 million doses of Covishield, with an expected production of 300 million doses by July. With limited domestic inoculation capacity, India has excess vaccines for diplomatic purposes.

“India’s vaccine diplomacy focuses on donations to its neighboring countries in South Asia and partners in Southeast Asia and Africa.”
India has actively engaged in bilateral and, to a lesser extent, multilateral vaccine diplomacy. Being a lower-middle-income country itself, India is a recipient as well as a contributor to the COVAX initiative. Yet as a major producer of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, it has pledged to deliver 240 million doses in the first half of 2021. India, however, has spent comparatively more resources on bilateral deals and donations. While the first COVAX shipments did not arrive in countries until the end of February, India’s bilateral donations started in early January. India’s vaccine diplomacy focuses on donations to its neighboring countries in South Asia and partners in Southeast Asia and Africa. Under its “neighborhood first” policy, India donated 2 million doses to Bangladesh, 1.5 million to Myanmar, 1 million to Nepal, 500,000 each to Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, 150,000 to Bhutan, 100,000 each to Cambodia and Maldives, and 50,000 to Seychelles in January. In February, India extended its donations to Caribbean countries, offering 570,000 doses to fifteen countries. These countries have a substantial Indian diaspora. So far, India has supplied 6 million doses of vaccine aid and 29.4 million doses as commercial exports, including to major economies such as Brazil, Algeria, South Africa, and Egypt, as well as some countries that received vaccine donations, such as Myanmar and Bangladesh.

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE NEW NORMAL IN ASIA
China’s and India’s approaches to vaccine diplomacy differ in ambition, strategy, and operationalization. Neither is doing pure charity, and vaccine aid is a small portion of the exported volume of doses. Both countries prioritize bilateral channels to conduct vaccine diplomacy.

China has a global ambition to provide vaccines to developing countries across regions as it aspires to become an economic and technology giant with unrivaled R&D as well as manufacturing capabilities. To achieve this goal, it has invested heavily in vaccine development, transnational clinical trials, and marketing, which ultimately won orders for hundreds of millions of doses. China’s vaccine diplomacy, just like its “go out” policy and Belt and Road Initiative, also aims to export jobs, technology, and supply chains.

India’s ambition, on the other hand, is more regional. With no self-developed vaccine, India’s vaccine diplomacy is built on its role as the main manufacturer for AstraZeneca, which allows it to produce vaccines at low cost and distribute them with little resistance. This means that the country’s vaccine diplomacy is conducted through aid as opposed to commercial sales, which limits its scale and form.

China and India do not conduct vaccine diplomacy independent of one another. Although differing in geopolitical ambition and diplomatic tactics, they compete for international recognition and influence over developing countries. A number of these countries, such as Nepal, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka, have received donations from both countries, and the donations differ with either power’s willingness to strengthen or repair the relationship. China, for example, donated 300,000 vaccine doses to Nepal a week after India delivered 1 million doses. Likewise, India announced that it would donate 100,000 doses to Cambodia a day after the country received 1 million doses from China.

Unlike military and resource competition, however, this competition to provide public goods offers more opportunity than risks to regional countries. Neither China’s nor India’s vaccine aid or sales are exclusive, and smaller countries are better off by diversifying their vaccine supply and hedging between powers to get more doses. This dynamic has important implications for the new normal in Asia.

As climate change increases the likelihood of health crises and natural disasters that call for greater provision of public goods, the continuing competition between Asia’s two largest rising powers could create positive spillover effects for the rest of the region. Prominent examples are China’s Belt and Road Initiative and the Indian-led International Solar Alliance. Although neither country is keen to join the other’s transnational initiative, both initiatives have and are investing in infrastructure across South and Southeast Asia.

On the other hand, this competition in health diplomacy has its own risks. Although, as analyzed above, China and India differ in their strategies and tactics, they do operate in the same region, and their health diplomacy can intersect with other dimensions where they are more competitive or even confrontational. The dynamics between the two countries are also influenced by major powers outside the region. At the recent Quad Summit, for example, the United States, Japan, and Australia worked with India and pledged to supply up to 1 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses across Asia by the end of 2022 to counter China’s growing influence. If competition intensifies to the point that smaller countries must take sides, that will bring new uncertainties to the Indo-Pacific.",,"March 19, 2021",The National Bureau of Asian Research,Rising-Power Competition: The Covid-19 Vaccine Diplomacy of China and India,
2022/0076,Article,https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2021/04/22/ensuring-vaccine-for-all-in-the-world-bangladesh-perspective/,"Health experts and analysts argue that the massive scale of vaccination is the most effective way to save people and the economy around the globe. Meanwhile, one can see a timid response of the global institutions in this regard. The neglect of multilateralism since the very inception of this crisis exacerbated the efforts of different countries, particularly in the developing and underdeveloped regions. The US withdrawal from World Health Organization (WHO) under the Trump Administration greatly hampered the global process in the early days of COVID-19. However, the US has rejoined WHO under the Biden Administration, but it has already been delayed and slowed down the global engagement. As a result, we have witnessed hectic vaccine diplomacy over the past year, where bilateral frameworks have played a pivotal role. It may be mentioned that COVAX was launched by WHO, EU and France in 2020 to deal with the global accessibility of COVID-19 vaccines. Coordinated by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the WHO, COVAX aims to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations, rich and poor. However, the worrying issue is that the current level of access to vaccines for the developing and least developed nations is extremely low compared to the developed and rich countries. Against this backdrop, the vaccine for all becomes a critical global need to overcome the biggest humanitarian crisis in a century. Bangladesh has a unique contribution to advance the goal of vaccine for all, for that matter, facilitating the availability and accessibility of COVID-19 vaccines to every corner of the world.

With a motto of ‘vaccine for all’, the Bangladesh Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, warned the world during her speech for the 31st Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)in September 2020. Bangladesh placed a three-point proposal in the special UNGA session to deal with the challenge of COVID-19: ensuring universal and equitable access to quality Covid-19 vaccine, transferring technology to developing countries to manufacture it locally, and providing them with financial assistance to face challenges in wake of the pandemic. She vehemently asserted that the COVID vaccine is for the global public good. In her words, “It is imperative to treat the vaccine as a ‘global public good’.” In this context, the World Health Organization (WHO) initiative of Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) and Covax facility can play a vital role in this regard. Highlighting the global responsibility of achieving the 2030 Development agenda of the fundamental role of Universal Health Coverage for achieving the SDGs guided by the principle of equity, Bangladesh underscored the need for universal access to vaccines. She argued, “In the same spirit, when it comes to access to vaccines, no one should be left behind … This would help us to defeat the pandemic, save lives and accelerate our economic recovery.”

Bangladesh Prime Minister called upon the developed countries to commit to technology transfer for the local manufacturing of vaccines in developing countries, using IP rights waiver under TRIPS Agreement. Sheikh Hasina reminded the international community that the fates of people across the globe were intertwined amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as she called on world leaders to ensure that any proven vaccine is made accessible to all at the same time. She also highlighted the need for multilateralism and reiterated Bangladesh’s ‘unflinching commitment’ to multilateralism as embodied in the UN Charter. She clearly spelled out, “The pandemic has indeed aggravated existing global challenges. It has also reinforced the indispensability of multilateralism.”She emphasized, “The UN, International Financial Institutions (IFIs), civil society alongside the national governments must do their share and actively cooperate with each other to combat Covid-19.” The crux of multilateralism on the COVID-19 global pandemic is pumping necessary financial assistance to the developing countries.

Bangladesh also pointed out that the world should recognize the vaccine manufacturing capacities of developing countries like Bangladesh. She floated the idea that Bangladesh’s pharmaceutical industry has the capacity to mass-produce a vaccine if given the “technical know-how and patents.”Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina asserted that Bangladesh is ready to produce Covid-19 vaccines. It is critical to remember that Bangladesh did forecast the current scenarios of vaccine crisis and politics long ago. The situation gets further worse when the US, the UK, and the European Union have all blocked the move of nearly 100 developing countries who petitioned the World Trade Organization (WTO) to temporarily waive intellectual property protections on vaccines during the pandemic so that they could manufacture generic vaccines domestically. Besides, developing countries, including Bangladesh, approached vaccine producing companies such as Oxford-AstraZeneca to share technical know-how and patents, which has not seen any positive responses. Serum Institute of India, a co-manufacturer of Oxford-AstraZeneca also appealed to the US President Joe Biden to consider exporting raw materials for producing COVID-19 vaccines. Besides, a local company in Bangladesh, Globe Biotech Ltd, also joined the global COVID-19 vaccine race with the announcement of its vaccine named Bongavax that started clinical trials.

The Bangladesh Prime Minister reiterated her vision for the vaccine for all at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference virtually held on 20 April 2021. She clearly uttered that COVID-19 vaccines should be declared as global public goods. She asserted, “Countries producing the vaccines should help others produce the vaccines with a view to attaining universal vaccine coverage.”All nations and international organizations must work together to meet the medical requirements of this pandemic. WHO, GAVI and other relevant organizations must uphold the rights of member states and ensure equity and justice. The prime minister called the COVID-19 pandemic possibly the “greatest global challenge” and emphasized it had brought the world to a crossroad of human history. As cautioned by the Bangladesh Prime Minister in September 2020, the world witnesses a horrific race for vaccines leaving behind billions of marginalized people in the world.

The neglect of the causes of the survival of a great number of humanity by relying on politics, parochial national interests, and diplomatic considerations, the developed world will jeopardize the existence of global society. The so-called diplomacy of ‘zero-sum’ gains has brought about a devastating impact in the age of new normal. One can see alarming statistics of current scenarios in the world regarding vaccine procurement. Out of total worldwide confirmed purchases of Covid-19 vaccines, high-income country confirmed dose total 4.6 billion, upper-middle-income country totals 1.3 billion, lower-middle-income country total 608 million, low-income country total 670 million and COVAX total 1.12 billion. Besides, vaccine diplomacy has turned into a race for intensifying bilateral frameworks that contributes to more competition and rivalry in the world. Countries from Africa to Latin America have been witnessing this trend. Rivalries between the vaccine manufacturing countries such as the US vs China, Russia vs the US, India vs China, EU vs Russia and China are on display in the global arena.  

In conclusion, Bangladesh’s 3-point proposal in fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic through equitable access to vaccines must be the basis of any global or regional initiatives. It is the formula for saving humanity from the greatest disaster on earth. It is an inescapable option for the world to immediately declare COVID-19 vaccine as a public good that the Bangladesh Prime Minister urged to the world in the UNGA in 2020. Intellectual property rights mechanisms be immediately relaxed for sharing technology with Pharmaceutical companies in countries like Bangladesh, Brazil, India and Indonesia to produce vaccines for the world. Fair and equitable access to the COVID-19 vaccines must be based on the slogan of ‘vaccine for all’ and no time lost or delayed to save the humanity and economy.

China and a few other countries, including the US, have pledged vaccines to the tiny Himalayan country, which was in a spot to complete its full vaccination schedule due to the shortage of jabs for the second dose due in mid-July.

Bhutan is receiving 50,000 doses of Sinopharm from China, 500,000 doses of Moderna from the US, 250,000 doses of AstraZeneca from Denmark, another over 100,000 doses of AstraZeneca from Croatia, Bulgaria and a few other countries and 5,850 doses of Pfizer from international COVAX alliance facility, according to a UNICEF press release.

As the fresh supply of vaccines started arriving, Bhutan has now geared up to roll out the much-anticipated second dose of vaccine from July 20, according to the Kuensel, Bhutan’s ‘national newspaper’.

China’s vaccine diplomacy with Bhutan also assumed significance as the two countries in April this year had an “in-depth and fruitful discussions” on the boundary issue. It was seen as a major breakthrough as only last year Bhutan had issued a demarche to China for declaring the kingdom’s Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary along the border as a disputed territory.

The sanctuary is not very far from Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. The pandemic seems to be now helping Bhutan and China to come close.

Another Indian neighbour Bangladesh resumed its stalled inoculation drive from July 8 after receiving vaccines from China and the US.

After a successful launch of a pilot vaccination programme on January 27 this year, Bangladesh started a nationwide drive on February 7 administering Covishield vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India.

The Bangladesh government had to suspend its nationwide mass vaccination programme on April 25, after India stopped exporting the vaccines as its domestic demand skyrocketed following a deadly second surge.

Prior to the second COVID wave in India, New Delhi in January this year had launched its Vaccine Maitri initiative to donate millions of doses of free vaccines to neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.

Under the initiative, India had provided 5,50,000 doses of Covishield to Bhutan for its first round of vaccinations and another 30, 20,000 doses to Bangladesh apart from other neighbours to reaffirm its ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy.

Bangladesh had also signed a deal with India in December last year to procure 3 crore doses of Covishield in installments from the Serum Institute. It could procure only 70 lakh doses before India imposed the export ban, halting Bangladesh’s vaccination drive.

As the ban compelled India’s neighbours to look for alternative sources, China grabbed the opportunity to exert its soft power by stepping in to fill the gap.

Beijing has pledged vaccines to Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar among other South Asian countries, according to reports from these countries.

UNICEF press release said for the second dose, “His Majesty (King of Bhutan)” had advised the government that “sourcing vaccines from India once more would be inconsiderate” given the shortage of vaccines and a surge of cases in the country at the time.

Besides Bhutan, China will be sending 60 lakh doses of vaccines to Myanmar while it has already “gifted” 11 lakh doses of Sinopharm vaccine to Bangladesh.

The Bangladesh media on Tuesday (July 13) quoted the country’s foreign minister AK Abdul Momen as saying that he would be meeting his Chinese counterpart in Tashkent on July 15 as China would donate one million more doses of Sinopharm vaccine to Bangladesh.

Meanwhile, quoting a senior official of Myanmar’s information ministry, a news agency on Wednesday (July 14) reported that the country’s military government had “bought” four million doses from China while it would get another two million jabs from Beijing.

Growing dependency of Indian neighbours on China for vaccines has not gone unnoticed at the South Block as the sources said India has urged the USA to help out the South Asian countries to mitigate the crisis to counter the Chinese influence.

It was part of this counter China strategy that the US stepped up its vaccination outreach in India’s backyards including Bhutan, with which it has no formal diplomatic relations.",https://thefederal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Covid-19-Vaccine-development-e1599531596297-696x392.jpg,"15 July, 2021",The Federal ,China goes for COVID vaccine outreach in India’s backyard amid shortages,
2022/0078,News,https://www.opindia.com/2021/01/china-india-bangladesh-vaccine-diplomacy-serum-institute-maitri-sinovac-south-asia/,"Days after Bangladesh rejected the Chinese coronavirus vaccine over the efficacy issues in favor of vaccines developed by Indian companies, the Communist Party of China has taken offense and has now blamed ‘India’s influence’ behind Bangladesh’s decision to dump their vaccine.

The Chinese government mouthpiece Global Times on Tuesday published an article blaming India for ‘meddling’ between the affairs of China and Bangladesh.According to a Hindustan Times report, the Bangladesh government, amidst the questions over the Chinese vaccine’s efficacy, had rejected Sinovac’s CoronaVac vaccine and obtained India’s Covishield doses under the Modi government’s ‘Vaccine Maitri’ initiative. It is being said that Bangladesh had rejected the Chinese vaccine after Beijing had brazenly asked Dhaka to share costs of clinical trials of Sinovac manufactured drug in the country.

Since October 2020, the Chinese government was insisting Bangladesh on signing a contract to supply CoronaVac vaccines. However, one of the terms of the contract was that Dhaka had to share the expense of the clinical trials carried out by Sinovac. As Dhaka rejected the agreement, the Chinese company said that Bangladesh could not be an exception as Sinovac was putting the same conditions for other countries who intend to procure their vaccine.

Realizing the Chinese trap, Bangladesh turned towards its ally India and tied up with SII for a commercial supply of 30 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Three million doses of commercial supplies have already been sent to Dhaka.

China blames India after Bangladesh rejects their vaccine
The Chinese government mouthpiece, blaming India for meddling behind Bangladesh’s decision to halt Sinovac vaccine trials in the country, claimed that sharing cost for clinical trials is normal and it was due to India’s ‘meddling’ that Bangladesh rejected SinoVac’s offer.

In its report, the Global Times claimed that the Bangladeshi government had earlier agreed that Sinovac conducted clinical trials on CoronaVac in Bangladesh in July and had planned to carry out the trials since August. 

However, the clinical trials were delayed until October due to the Indian government’s alleged interference between Bangladesh-China cooperation during the period, according to Global Times. As it got delayed, Sinovac had started trials in Brazil and Turkey and did not find external financial support for the clinical trials in Bangladesh. Hence, the company had to negotiate with the Bangladeshi government about sharing the cost to launch the clinical trials, the report claimed.

Quoting Feng Duojia, president of the China Vaccine Industry Association, the report said, “In international cooperative clinical trials, it is normal for partners to share the cost based on negotiations. Usually, vaccine producers will offer to donate vaccines, or transfer some technology or help the partners build production lines as compensation”.

The report further said that it was normal for international partners to reach cooperation after reaching agreements and normalising cooperation if an agreement is not reached. ‘No one should use this as an excuse to smear any of the partners’, the report said.
The Chinese government mouthpiece, holding India responsible for the humiliation meted out to them by Bangladesh, claimed that India was smearing China’s cooperation with South Asia countries in cooperation on the anti-epidemic fight.

“India always treats China as a simulated enemy that can affect its influence in South Asia and reduce South Asian countries’ reliance on India,” the report quoted an expert. The article also cited a Chinese expert Tian Guangqiang stating that India wants to ‘monopolize’ the vaccine market in South Asia and is using its influence in the region to market its vaccines.

India supplies free vaccines, facilitates commercial supply to Bangladesh
In contrast to the Chinese ‘transactional’ nature, India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, had lent a hand of help to Bangladesh by sending a gift of two million doses of Covishield vaccine to Dhaka on January 21 and also facilitated a commercial contract of 30 million doses with vaccine manufacturer SII.

In fact, the Indian gift to Bangladesh was in tune with PM Modi’s assurance to Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina during the December 17, 2020, virtual summit. The two countries have been cooperating in the coronavirus vaccine field, including Phase III testing, distribution, co-production, and delivery in Bangladesh.

Not just Bangladesh, even Sri Lanka, and Nepal have expressed their fear against the Chinese vaccine to their Indian interlocutors. India has already sent over five million doses of the coronavirus vaccine to seven countries in the neighbourhood, the first being Bhutan on January 20 and the latest being Mauritius on January 22.

2022/0079,News,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/india-losing-ground-in-its-south-asia-covid-19-vaccine-diplomacy-plan,"NEW DELHI - With India scrambling to procure Covid-19 vaccines as infection numbers soar, neighbouring countries that relied on the South Asian giant for vaccines have increasingly turned to China.

Analysts said the move would give Beijing an opportunity to increase its presence in South Asia.

China has donated one million doses of vaccines - out of which 800,000 were delivered on Tuesday (June 1) - to Nepal.

It also gave 500,000 to Bangladesh, 200,000 to the Maldives, 550,000 to Bhutan and 1.1 million to Sri Lanka.

Bangladesh is also buying an additional 15 million doses from China.

India, whose Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar was in the United States recently to seek vaccines, has not expressed any intention of procuring Chinese vaccines amid a deterioration of ties over a border dispute that is slowly being resolved.

""The decision of countries in South Asia and India's neighbourhood to buy Chinese vaccines will increase Chinese footprint,"" said Professor Harsh Pant, director of studies at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi.""And the Chinese generally give nothing for free. Clearly, I think more than financial demands, there will be political demands as we have seen with other sorts of help that China has provided to India's neighbours.""

India rolled out an ambitious vaccine diplomacy at the start of the year.

In March, a top Indian diplomat told the United Nations General Assembly that India has supplied more Covid-19 vaccine doses globally than it has used to vaccinate its own people.

But then the second wave hit and the government had to prioritise domestic needs.

This has left nations such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Maldives in a dilemma.

Some, like Bhutan, which in April stunned the world by vaccinating 62 per cent of its population of 800,000 in 16 days, are now looking beyond India to continue its vaccination drive.

""India is a reliable friend and will give the second dose if asked, but given India's greater need to save lives, Bhutan should not pressure it,"" said Prime Minister Lotay Tshering in May.The smaller neighbours, just like India, have been hit by a surge in infections.

Nepal has seen cases go up to 8,000 last month, with its health infrastructure under extreme stress.

It bought 2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from Serum Institute of India, but due to India's domestic needs, it has only received 1 million doses so far.

Nepal is also sourcing 100,000 doses of the Pfizer shot.

""Nepal had a hope that India would meet its vaccine requirements. That is why Nepal did not take many initiatives to purchase vaccines from other countries. Now, the Serum Institute of India has come up with a statement that it can export vaccines (only) by the end of this year,"" said journalist Kamal Dev Bhattarai, who added that India had ""created goodwill"" in Nepal with its vaccine diplomacy.

""As India itself is in crisis this time, I do not think there would be set back in neighbourhood policy. But it has provided space for China to increase its political influence.""

But acquiring Chinese vaccines has not been without controversies.

Pricing has emerged as an issue as Indian vaccines cost between US$4 (S$5.30) and US$5 a dose. Chinese vaccines are double the price.

Maldives, reports said, was not looking at sourcing vaccines from China and was sourcing for AstraZeneca vaccine supplies.

In Sri Lanka, controversy even broke out over reports that it had bought Chinese vaccines at a higher cost than Bangladesh.

According to Sri Lanka's Daily Mirror newpaper, the country is paying US$15 a dose for the Sinopharm vaccine, which is US$5 higher than what Bangladesh paid.

The report was denied by the Sri Lankan government.

""Less developed countries are concerned about prices. This is where price sensitivity comes up,"" said Dr Srikanth Kondapalli, professor in Chinese Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

Prof Pant said that it remained to be seen how and if the United States, Europe, Australia or Japan will step in to fill the vaccine void.

""A lot of the countries are not comfortable with Chinese vaccines and they want alternatives,"" he said.

2022/0080,News,https://www.who.int/news/item/20-05-2022-covax-calls-for-urgent-action-to-close-vaccine-equity-gap,"Nearly 18 months after the first administration of a COVID-19 vaccine, incredible progress has been made – with lower-income countries administering billions of COVID-19 vaccines in a historic global rollout that is unprecedented in terms of speed, scale and demographics reached. Yet despite this progress, and the easing of global supply constraints, inequities between lower and higher income countries are continuing to cost lives and are prolonging the pandemic by increasing the threat posed by the emergence of new, potentially more dangerous variants of the virus.

Only 16% of people in low-income countries have received a single vaccine dose – compared to 80% in high-income countries. In certain lower-income countries, many of the most at-risk people in society – healthcare workers, the elderly and those with underlying health conditions – are going unprotected while young, healthy adults receive booster doses in wealthier countries.

The world must act urgently to close this equity gap.

After a year of severe constraints, we are now in a situation that two years ago would have seemed impossible: namely global supply is now high enough to underpin the overarching objective of supporting equitable, full vaccination of all adult and adolescent populations globally. COVAX has access to more than enough doses needed to enable 91 lower-income countries that are supported by the COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC) – which provides donor-funded doses of a wide variety of COVID-19 vaccines – to meet their targets in light of the WHO global target of protecting 70% of the population in each country. We can support these countries to meet individual targets and prioritize full coverage of high-risk groups. In accordance with the updated SAGE roadmap of January 2022 – which recommends boosters for priority groups – COVAX is now open to and encouraging requests for doses for booster campaigns from countries.

COVAX is also well-placed to deliver these doses so they reach those in need. In just 15 months, COVAX – as the Vaccines Pillar of the ACT-Accelerator partnership for equitable access to COVID-19 tools – has shipped over 1.3 billion vaccines to 87 low and lower-middle income countries around the world. COVAX shipments account for 82% of vaccines delivered to low-income countries and the majority of COVID-19 vaccines administered in humanitarian settings. Through driving the fastest, largest and most complex global vaccination effort in history, COVAX’s work has helped raise the average proportion of people protected by a full course of vaccines in these low- and lower-middle income countries to 46%.

The onus now is on building on this foundation to help countries to fully protect high risk groups, meet  national vaccination targets, and close the global COVID-19 vaccine equity gap for good. However, hurdles now remain: demand and uptake are low, with low-income countries remaining the furthest behind.

Demand and delivery
With more than 3.8 billion COVID-19 doses administered to-date, national governments in lower-income countries have led the way. The number of countries with coverage under 10% of the population has decreased from 34 in January to 18 today. Some AMC-supported countries – for example, Bhutan, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Maldives, Fiji and Bangladesh – have coverage above 70%.

Building on country readiness efforts undertaken so far, the countries furthest behind are receiving tailored support. In January 2022, WHO, UNICEF and Gavi established the COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery Partnership (CoVDP), an inter-agency initiative building on existing resources globally, regionally and in-country to support COVID-19 vaccine delivery in lower-income countries. CoVDP specifically provides urgent operational support to the 34 countries that were at or below 10% full vaccination coverage in January 2022, many of which are in Africa. By mid-April 2022, a total of US$29 million of urgent funding was coordinated and disbursed - within 15 working days or less - to ten countries across the three agencies. The CoVDP has driven political engagement with several countries with low vaccination rates to keep vaccine delivery on top of the political agenda and identify opportunities for bundling COVID-19 vaccinations with other health interventions.

While CoVDP and other efforts are helping lower-income countries make progress, challenges still need to be addressed. In many countries Omicron has reduced the perceived risk of the virus and there are other health priorities that people and governments are focused on. The option of integrating COVID-19 vaccination with other health systems activities – for example, measles and polio campaigns, or the distribution of malaria bed nets, – therefore becomes more important. COVID-19 vaccination is also an opportunity to strengthen health systems including training health workers, enhancing health management information systems, further improving the cold chain, and forging new ways of working in fragile and conflict settings. 

Through our continuous dialogue with AMC-supported countries, we know that demand is highly dynamic and difficult to predict, even for countries themselves. Thanks to input from national governments, COVAX is able to make some initial estimates of overall demand from AMC-supported countries. From our analysis of the latest demand planning forecasts provided to us by these countries, estimated country demand from now through early 2023 currently stands at approximately 330 million doses from COVAX, in addition to what has already been delivered or accepted by countries. However, these continue to be dynamic figures, and will evolve with situations on the ground as well as the occurrence of new variants.  As such, COVAX will be working with national governments to continuously update these estimates.

In order for the world to continue to make meaningful progress on closing the global vaccine equity gap, we urgently call on countries to set ambitious targets backed by concrete plans for implementation – prioritising full coverage of high risk groups – and on all partners to coordinate on providing countries with the resources needed to accelerate and expand national strategies, stimulate demand and overcome operational bottlenecks. The next 3-4 months are crucial for accelerating COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, alongside moving to integrate COVID-19 vaccination efforts into routine primary health systems.

Supply
It is testament to the ground-breaking work of the scientific and manufacturing communities that there is now enough global supply to meet needs, as is the fact that it took only 327 days to go from the SARS-CoV-2 virus being sequenced and published to bringing a COVID-19 vaccine into emergency use.

As we strive to help countries deploy more doses, we must also work ensure supply remains available, at the right times. COVAX experienced delays securing doses in 2021. With many doses from advance purchase agreements now becoming available alongside donated doses, and the dynamic nature of country demand coupled with global oversupply, it is highly likely that overall supply will exceed demand. However, COVAX is working with manufacturers to help make supply more responsive to the changing demand environment.

That both global and COVAX supply now exceed demand is an advantageous situation in a pandemic, as it guarantees all countries long term availability of supply and choice of product. Protecting populations rapidly must now take priority. This is fundamental, given that 2021 clearly demonstrated the impact ad hoc, unpredictable supply had on the ability for countries with more limited health systems resources to plan and roll-out vaccination campaigns. Certainty of supply enables countries to plan national vaccination campaigns with more confidence, ensures a rolling buffer of stock can be available in-country and aids smooth and efficient roll outs.

While every effort should be taken to minimize wastage and expiry, lower income countries should also be able to accept doses, and to aim high, without being stigmatized when there is wastage, which is an inevitable part of immunization efforts against any disease, in any country.

COVAX is committed to providing countries with long-term, predictable supply, catering to all contexts and maintaining reserves to ensure supply can keep up with shifts in demand. This includes working with manufacturers and donors to ensure any new, variant-adapted vaccines reach COVAX at the same time as higher income countries.

We call on donor countries and manufacturers to support COVAX by ensuring the volume and timing of deliveries match as closely as possible the needs of lower-income countries. Donors should support COVAX in maintaining a diverse portfolio, including variant-adapted vaccines if necessary. Manufacturers should work with COVAX to re-phase or re-size supply from existing advance purchase agreements.

A world beset by numerous challenges and crises does not change the fact that the pandemic – our collective crisis – is far from over. Closing the vaccine equity gap must continue to be an urgent priority for the international community.",,20 May 2022,WHO,COVAX calls for urgent action to close vaccine equity gap,
2022/0081,Article,https://www.nature.com/articles/nindia.2021.31,"After rolling out its country-wide inoculation programme in January 2021, India has sent out 5.6 million doses of anti-COVID-19 vaccines as gifts to needy countries. Regarded as the world’s vaccine manufacturing hub, India also shipped 10 million commercial units to 17 neighbouring states, West Asia, Africa, and Latin America early this year.

With the ‘Vaccine Maitri’ (maitri is Hindi for friendship) diplomatic mission, launched on 20 January 2021, India is aiming to bridge the world’s vaccine divide. The mission includes vaccine gifts to needy neighbours Bhutan (0.15 million doses), Maldives (0.1 million), Nepal (1 million), Bangladesh (2 million), Myanmar (1.5 million), Mauritius (0.1 million), Seychelles (0.05 million), Sri Lanka (0.5 million), Bahrain (0.1 million) and Oman (0.1 million). Other beneficiaries of India’s strength in vaccine production are the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) countries (0.5 million doses), Nicaragua and the Pacific Island states (0.2 million doses each). India will also supply affordable vaccines to Saudi Arabia, Canada and Mongolia. Under the GAVI-COVAX alliance, India hopes to supply 10 million doses to Africa and 1 million to UN health workers.

According to India’s Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, 25 countries are in the queue to receive vaccines from India in three categories – poor countries, countries which are price sensitive, and those directly buying from the vaccine manufacturers. India has also supported the temporary suspension of COVID-19 vaccine intellectual property rights pledging international cooperation for fair and equitable access to vaccines. The country’s National Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) provides export clearances after securing adequate doses for domestic purposes.

Vaccine diplomacy is not new. It has been a part of science and health diplomacy since the discovery of the smallpox vaccine in 1798. Britain’s Edward Jeener discovered the smallpox vaccine and offered advice on its administration to countries like Russia, Turkey, Spain, Canada, and Mexico. The creation of a network of laboratories in Francophone countries, Indochina and North Africa to prepare and administer the rabies vaccine by the French Pasteur Institute in the late 1800s is another example of vaccine diplomacy. The eradication of poliovirus from the world was largely made possible due to the scientific collaboration between the American-Polish developer of the oral polio vaccine Albert Sabin and Soviet virologists during the Cold War.

India is the largest hub of pharmaceuticals and meets 20 per cent of the world’s demand for generic medicines, and more than 60 per cent of the global demand for vaccines1. Despite domestic demand, India supplied hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and paracetamol tablets, as well as diagnostic kits, ventilators, masks, gloves, and other medical supplies to many countries in the fight against COVID-19. According to one estimate, India has spent more than $16 million on therapeutics, test kits, and other medical equipment for about 90 countries during the current pandemic2.

Two vaccines – Covishield by Serum Institute in collaboration with AstraZeneca and Covaxin by Bharat Biotech – are available for use in India after regulators granted them emergency use approval earlier this year. The approval for Covaxin for ‘restricted use in emergency under clinical trial mode’ pending phase three clinical trial data faced some criticism. The vaccine, rolled out in the country-wide inoculation drive under clinical trial mode after regulators considered it safe based on phase two clinical trial results, is being monitored for adverse events. According to India’s Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, seven other vaccines are in the pipeline in India and, if successful, will be added to India’s vaccine repertoire to meet both domestic and global demand. Indian vaccines are easier to distribute as they can be stored in ordinary refrigerators at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius in contrast to vaccines that require expensive deep-freeze chains for storage at -20 to -70 degrees Celsius.

Building clinical trial capacity in neighbouring countries and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is also a priority for India, according to Department of Biotechnology secretary Renu Swarup. Her department is working with India’s external affairs ministry to facilitate phase III clinical trials of Covaxin in Bangladesh and Myanmar. India is training several neighbouring countries to strengthen their clinical capabilities under the Partnerships for Accelerating Clinical Trials (PACT) and Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation (ITEC) programmes.

The World Health Organsation recently recognised India’s vaccine altruism as a facilitator of equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Though, how long India can shoulder the financial burden of providing free vaccine doses to neighbouring countries is still a question.",https://media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-assets/nindia.2021.31/nindia.2021.31_19310868.jpg,17 February 2021,nature india,India’s vaccine diplomacy aids global access to COVID-19 jabs,
2022/0082,Article,https://bangladeshpost.net/posts/time-to-rethink-the-strategy-of-vaccine-diplomacy-62794,"Even eight months earlier, Bangladesh's people had to wait impatiently to learn when they would be able to obtain the COVID-19 vaccination, which would allow them to travel freely after a long stay at home to avoid COVID-19 infection? At every step, there was intense debate over whether the Bangladeshi government would purchase vaccinations once they were ready to be delivered. 

We are all aware that several companies from various countries have produced vaccines. The Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine was the most frequently discussed, followed by the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. After that, Sputnik-V, a Russian vaccine, and Sino pharm, a Chinese vaccine, both came out quickly to safeguard individuals from getting infected. Several Indian firms are also competing to produce the COVID-19 vaccine.

While the Russian vaccine was the first to be developed and delivered to Russian citizens, including the Russian President's daughter, they were not sold outside of the country. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna's vaccine, on the other hand, were authorised by the US Drug Administration and began to be administered to the general public in the United States. 

In addition, these companies began distributing vaccinations to countries across the world, including the United Kingdom. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, on the other hand, is difficult to store since it must be kept at minus 70 degrees. As a result, in Bangladesh, the use of this vaccination is extremely challenging due to the lack of infrastructures throughout the country.

For numerous reasons, the Oxford and AstraZeneca Vaccine has been deemed the most beneficial in Bangladesh, considering the benefits and drawbacks of several vaccines. The first rationale was that many participants stayed connected in the clinical study for this vaccination, implying that this vaccine effectively protects people against COVID-19 contamination. 

We have already witnessed the Sheikh Hasina government's success 

in vaccine diplomacy. When many governments across the globe were 

struggling to organise immunisations for their population, more than 

10 million Bangladeshis received second doses of vaccine

The second argument is that the vaccine is relatively easy to preserve because it may be kept at a normal temperature. According to the third argument, the vaccine's pricing is comparatively inexpensive compared to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Finally, Oxford and AstraZeneca have reached an agreement with the Serum Institute of India to manufacture the vaccine for Asian countries, making it more accessible to us.

Many individuals, however, were skeptical of the Bangladesh government's ability to organise enough vaccine for the population. They were even perplexed as to whether or not the government would provide the vaccination free of charge. On the other hand, the Bangladesh government has demonstrated its trustworthiness in vaccine diplomacy in several ways under the dynamic leadership of Sheikh Hasina. 

The first is that the government could negotiate a deal with the Serum Institute of India to acquire 30 million doses of the Oxford and AstraZeneca vaccine within the shortest possible time. The agreement's most essential clause stated that Serum Institute would provide vaccines in six consignments containing five million doses. Another requirement was that the Serum Institute would provide the first shipment of the vaccine within thirty days of the Bangladeshi drug administration's clearance. 

The government's second critical strategic choice is to give free vaccinations to about 14 crore people. We all know that minors under 18 are not authorised to receive the vaccination because no clinical research has been conducted on this population.

As per the provision of the contract, the Serum Institute started sending their consignments along with 3.2 million doses of the vaccines as the gift of the Indian Prime Minister on the eve of the celebration of the 50 years of the country's independence and the birth centenary of our Father of the Nation. 

Therefore, the government started the mass vaccination process from the first week of February 2021. The immunisation process was going swimmingly. However, due to the Indian government's imposition of a vaccine embargo because of the deteriorating COVID-19 situation in the second wave, the Serum Institute was forced to suspend shipping consignments of vaccines in Bangladesh. As a result, there was growing concern about the continuation of the vaccination process. 

After failing to receive vaccinations from the Serum Institute, Bangladesh's government began looking for other vaccine suppliers. As a result, after several dialogues, they signed a deal with Russia's Sputnik V and China's Sinopharm. China and Bangladesh engaged in several discussions. Finally, the government chose the Sinopharm to deliver 15 million vaccination doses. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has sent Bangladesh 1.1 million vaccination doses as a gift.

It is regrettable to report that the WHO has failed to assure equity in vaccine distribution. The world's giant economies, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and China, account for a lion share of vaccinations manufactured. As a result, it is critical to consider assuring vaccination distribution's equity among different nations worldwide.

The Bangladesh government should continue to discuss the vaccination issue with its Indian counterpart. Meanwhile, India's Foreign Minister has hinted that the country's decision on vaccine import may be reconsidered in July-August. Bangladesh's government should take advantage of this opportunity to obtain additional vaccinations from India. We should pay greater attention to the accumulation of these vaccinations for our population as the efficacy of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been proclaimed by international communities. We know that India has been a reliable partner of Bangladesh since the country's independence. As a result, reaching an agreement on importing vaccines from Serum Institute would not be a challenging feat. Therefore, both sides should sit together and try to solve this problem collectively.

We have already witnessed the Sheikh Hasina government's success in vaccine diplomacy. When many governments across the globe were struggling to organise immunisations for their population, more than 10 million Bangladeshis already received second doses of vaccine. Therefore, we want to keep trust in our Prime Minister, who has the credibility to persuade the Indian government to allow vaccinations to be imported into Bangladesh. We anticipate that both friendly neighboring nations will reach an agreement on the vaccine diplomacy deal soon.

During the pandemic, the government's foreign policy plays an important role in combating the fatal virus's disastrous consequences as an extension of domestic or national policy. Domestic and international policy is, in essence, two sides of the same coin, as domestic policies are developed and implemented following the broad direction of foreign policy. As a result, a government's economic and social status quo is not the sole determinant of its success. Instead, the government's legitimacy is determined by its ability to maintain contact with international communities and neighboring nations, especially during the darkest period of the century. From this vantage point, Sheikh Hasina has demonstrated her credibility in dealing with vaccination diplomacy. 

Now is the time to rethink the strategy of vaccine diplomacy and re-engage in vaccination negotiations with India.",,25 Jun 2021,Bangladesh Post,Time to rethink the strategy of vaccine diplomacy,
2022/0083,News,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/india-vaccine-diplomacy/2021/01/21/0d5f0494-5b49-11eb-a849-6f9423a75ffd_story.html,"NEW DELHI — India started vaccinating its own population against the coronavirus only a few days ago, but it is already using its manufacturing heft to generate goodwill with its neighbors.

India’s government has made the calculation that it has enough vaccine doses to share. The result is a form of vaccine diplomacy that appears to be unlike any other in the world.Since Wednesday, the Indian government has sent free doses to Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives — more than 3.2 million in total. Donations to Mauritius, Myanmar and Seychelles are set to follow. Sri Lanka and Afghanistan are next on the list.

The shipments reflect one of India’s unique strengths: It is home to a robust vaccine industry, including Serum Institute of India, one of the world’s largest vaccine makers.

Early in the pandemic, Serum Institute formed a partnership to produce the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. By this year, it had already stockpiled 80 million doses. Some of that production will be delivered this month to the ­Covax initiative backed by the World Health Organization to distribute vaccines to poorer countries.

On Thursday, a fire broke out at a building under construction at Serum Institute’s headquarters in which five people died, New Delhi Television reported. Serum Institute said the blaze would not impact its production of the AstraZeneca vaccine.In the race to combat the pandemic, several countries are using vaccine production as a route to enhance their global influence. But the Indian government seems to be the first to deliver multiple gifts to neighboring countries.

China has made a concerted push to sell its vaccines to countries around the globe for months but only recently announced donations to Myanmar, Cambodia and the Philippines. It is not clear if the free vaccines have been shipped.

On Thursday, Pakistan’s foreign minister had a call with his Chinese counterpart and announced that China would donate 500,000 vaccine doses by Jan. 31.

India’s diplomatic initiative has its own hashtag — #VaccineMaitri, or vaccine friendship — and received a high-profile plug from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India is “deeply honoured to be a long-trusted partner in meeting the healthcare needs of the global community,” he wrote on Twitter.

The push comes at a time when the virus is in retreat in India. The country is a distant second to the United States in terms of coronavirus cases, with about 10.6 million. Daily cases have dropped significantly since last fall.

India launched its nationwide vaccination drive, one of the world’s largest, on Jan. 16. The country is aiming to vaccinate 300 million people by the summer, starting with 10 million health-care personnel. Regulators fast-tracked the approval of two vaccines — the AstraZeneca vaccine and, more controversially, a vaccine called Covaxin developed in India that does not yet have efficacy data.

So far India is providing the AstraZeneca vaccine to its neighbors. Some analysts questioned whether the donations would have a lasting impact on existing sources of tension, such as a boundary dispute with Nepal.“You have neighbors who resent India’s overweening ways as it is,” said Manoj Joshi, a ­foreign policy analyst and senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. “I don’t think they’re going to be so terribly grateful that they forget all that.”

Conspicuously absent from the list of countries receiving free vaccine doses is Pakistan, India’s rival and neighbor to the west. The relationship between the two countries hit a nadir in 2019 when they engaged in their first aerial dogfight in nearly 50 years following a terrorist attack in Kashmir.

Pakistan recently approved the AstraZeneca vaccine. It has not approached India about a potential shipment, said two Indian officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter. “We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it,” one of the officials said.

A spokesman for Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry referred queries to the Health Ministry, which did not respond.

India is monitoring its vaccine supply on a weekly basis to make sure it can meet both domestic needs and demands from other countries, one of the Indian officials said. Commercial exports of the AstraZeneca vaccine — including to Brazil and Morocco — will begin within days.

Countries that received the free vaccine doses this week expressed their thanks. On Wednesday, an Indian military transport plane landed at the only international airport in Bhutan, a tiny Himalayan nation wedged between India and China. It carried 150,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, enough to vaccinate more than one-tenth of the total population targeted for immunization.

Lotay Tshering, Bhutan’s prime minister, said in a statement that the Bhutanese people were “immensely grateful” for the doses. “It is of unimaginable value when precious commodities are shared even before meeting your own needs.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HUNFUES4BQI6XOF55Y3LDTIYX4.jpg&w=916,"January 21, 2021",washingtonpost,India is giving away millions of coronavirus vaccine doses as a tool of diplomacy,

India sent one million doses of AstraZeneca’s Covishield vaccine to Nepal on Thursday, a gift that is likely to help repair strained ties between the neighbours.

Nepal’s Minister of Health Hridayesh Tripathi said the vaccine will be administered to health workers and other frontline personnel within a week to 10 days and that

Tripathi said Nepal would like to purchase four million more doses, and asked for the Indian government’s help in the matter.

“The government of India has shown goodwill by providing the vaccine in grant. This is at the people’s level, it is the public who are suffering the most from COVID-19,” said Tripathi.

Nepal’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Pradeep Gyawali flew to India last week to formally request the vaccine.

India’s gesture comes at a time when its ties with Nepal have been strained by a territorial dispute and Indian concern over China’s expanding political and economic influence in the Himalayan nation that lies sandwiched between the Asian giants.

China, which had promised Nepal help to deal with the pandemic, is awaiting Nepali clearance for its Sinopharm shots.

Bangladesh was supposed to get 110,000 doses of vaccine free of charge from Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech, but Dhaka refused to contribute towards the development cost of the vaccine, leading to a deadlock.

Bangladesh instead turned to India for urgent supplies and received two million vaccine doses as a gift on Thursday, with the government saying it plans to start inoculating the population of 168 million people next week.

Health Minister Zahid Maleque said Bangladesh is buying a further 30 million doses of the vaccine and expects to receive monthly consignments of five million doses.

Impoverished Bangladesh has seen 8,000 people die from coronavirus, although the pandemic has not been as bad as feared in a country with overcrowded cities and only 600 intensive care beds.

“India is making the AstraZeneca vaccine, which makes all the difference. It can be stored and transported at normal refrigerated temperatures and countries like Bangladesh have that facility,” a Bangladesh health official said.

‘Our moment to shine’
India for years has struggled to match the pace of Chinese investment in countries such as Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives, where China is building ports, roads and power stations as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.

But the demand for vaccines in these countries desperate to revive their tourism-dependent economies has offered Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government a way to claw back ground, diplomats say.

India is considering giving away anything from 12 million to 20 million shots to its neighbours in the first wave of assistance over the next three to four weeks, a government source told Reuters.

India is also helping with the training of health workers in some of these countries and the setting up of the infrastructure to administer the shots, the source said.

“It’s a well-crafted, calibrated series of actions you are seeing, they confirm the validity of our ‘neighbourhood first’ policy,” former Indian ambassador, Rajiv Bhatia, told Reuters.

“It plays to our strengths in science and pharma, and this is our moment to shine.”

2022/0085,Article,https://www.observerbd.com/news.php?id=274985,"It all began when the first patient was identified with Covid-19 on 31 December 2019, in Wuhan China. Since then, the world is experiencing an unprecedented crisis. Covid-19 has been labelled by some as a ""great equalizer"", as the virus has affected people from every sphere of life, across the world. However, so far, wealthy nations have the highest numbers of reported cases: the USA tops the list, followed by Spain, Italy, Germany, the UK and France. In the beginning, developing countries were comparatively doing well in terms of fighting against Covid-19.

However, now in developing countries, also the virus is growing exponentially. The consequence is same for each country; thousands have died, the health care system and economy have been crippled, many lost their jobs and so on. There is no denying that Bangladesh is the second most affected country in South Asia following India. Bangladesh has registered more than three hundred thousand Covid cases, more than four thousand death, and no fewer than two hundred thousand recoveries. Across the world, everyone is eagerly waiting for the most desirable vaccine or medicine that would bring this pandemic to an end. Bangladesh is also no exception to that.

Recently, the Bangladesh government has green lit the late-stage trial of a potential Chinese vaccine developed by Sinovac. The vaccine will be tested on health professionals, including doctors, nurses and other health workers. As per the initial plan, the vaccine will be tested on 4,200 volunteers under the supervision of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh or better known as icddr,b.

One the other hand, Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla in his recent visit to Bangladesh has assured that India will provide the vaccine to Bangladesh on a priority basis once it is ready. India's Serum Institute has already signed a deal with British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca which has partnered with the University of Oxford in Covid-19 vaccine development. Till the date, Oxford's vaccine has been considered as the most potential among other vaccines those are still on the pipeline. Therefore, Bangladesh has enough reasons to be happy about. There is no denying that Sringla's statement is an indication of continuing a strong bilateral relationship between Bangladesh and India.

It is good to see that Bangladesh is making sure not to pull all its eggs in one basket. Due to their geopolitical interests, both China and India have assured that Bangladesh will get the vaccine on a priority basis. After the diplomatic efforts of India and China for the trial of corona vaccine in Bangladesh, the government has finally permitted China for the first trial. Since China has been allowed to run the trial first, that doesn't mean that a chance will not be given to India. It is predicted that whenever India offers, Bangladesh will provide them with a chance to trial.

Diplomats believe that this has paved the way for getting the vaccine from both countries once it's ready. China has promised to give one lakh ten thousand doses to Bangladesh for free. It is learned that China will provide adequate vaccines to meet the needs of the large population of Bangladesh. It will be priced through mediation to ensure that the government and the people can afford it. They will transfer the technology of vaccine production by providing license to a pharmaceutical company in Bangladesh. it is true that this is a sign of goodwill of China during Bangladesh's crisis moment.

On the other hand, after the recent skirmishes along the border with China, India is looking to strengthen its bond with the neighbours, especially with Bangladesh. In recent time, apart from Bangladesh, India's relation with its neighbours is not going well. India's recent border dispute with Nepal, once the most trusted partner, is an evidence of that. Many have suspected that China has strong support behind Nepal's bold move. Moreover, China is trying to encircle India through its neighbours, and India is well aware of it.

Under this circumstance, it is not surprising that India wants to strengthen its relations with Bangladesh. This seems to be positive for Bangladesh. There is no doubt that both India and China will want to draw Bangladesh closer through vaccine diplomacy. However, the question remains as to how many doses India and China can give to Bangladesh after meeting the needs of their huge populations. Therefore, Bangladesh should keep in mind the vaccine diplomacy. It is high time Bangladesh ensure that it gets permission for manufacturing any vaccine locally to ensure its availability here in time.ince it is not sure which vaccine will eventually prove effective, Bangladesh will need to liaise with other potential vaccine-producing countries and reach an understanding for getting their vaccines once those are approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). Bangladesh should have diversified possible sources of vaccine, and must keep all the channels open. By relying only on India or China, Bangladesh may fall behind in the race to get the vaccine in time.

Bangladesh also needs to be vigilant about maintaining a balanced relationship with India and China amid the vaccine diplomacy. After Shringla's recent visit in Dhaka, foreign minister Dr AK Abdul Momen said that the relationships with China and India couldn't be compared. He termed Bangladesh's relation with India as 'rock solid' while he emphasized on the fact that economic issues mainly fixed Bangladesh's ties with China.",https://www.observerbd.com/2020/09/14/observerbd.com_1600104692.jpg,"15 September, 2020",daily observer,Vaccine diplomacy and Bangladesh’s quest for C-19 vaccine,

2022/0087,Article,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1874951,"The G7 summit starting on Friday will mark the first time that world leaders have met in person for almost two years. It is Joe Biden’s first such meeting as US president and Angela Merkel’s last as German chancellor. The gathering will also be the first test of what British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s oft-quoted “Global Britain” slogan actually means.
When thinking of past G7 summits, most people will remember little more than well-choreographed leaders’ photo opportunities. But on rare occasions, a G7 can bring meaningful policy breakthroughs. So it was in 2009 when, in consultation with African leaders, the Italian-hosted G8 broke new ground on international development. In introducing this session, I remember recounting fellow leaders of the story of a Rwanda schoolboy caught up in the genocide of the 1990s and now immortalized in the Kigali Genocide Memorial museum, where, in a section devoted to children, one can find his photograph and a plaque that reads:
David: Age 11
Ambition: To be a doctor
Favorite sport: Football
Favorite hobby: Making people laugh
Death: By mutilation
Last words: The UN is coming to save us.
In his idealism and innocence, David believed the international community would save him and his mother. We did not. David’s story was repeated by US President Barack Obama and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. We agreed that the international community had done too little to help people in mortal danger, and our communiqué announced our intention to do much more.
Once again, a life-and-death issue, and the costs of inaction, should be at the forefront of the G7’s agenda. Our failure so far to build on the development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines with a plan to immunize the whole world is unacceptable. Already, 3.8 million people around the world have died from COVID-19. Some 80,000 more are dying every week. And it is not an exaggeration to state that the G7’s members will decide who is vaccinated and safe and who remains unvaccinated and at risk.
In the last few days, the US has offered to supply 500 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to developing countries, and may offer more. The UK is expected to offer 100 million doses. Others will respond, too.
But the numbers being discussed fall short of the 11 billion doses needed. We need a continuous flow over the next few months and beyond to meet Johnson’s pledge to vaccinate the whole world by the end of 2022. Achieving this requires guaranteed funding and pooled purchasing that in turn leads to new manufacturing capacity and a secure pipeline of vaccine supply on every continent. And we need a decision to finance all of this now if we are to avoid the familiar vicious circle whereby the world fails to underwrite the costs and we fall short of the vaccination supplies we need.
The omens for the world’s poorest countries are not yet encouraging.

The world needs a decision by the G7 this week, or lives will continue to be lost. The world cannot afford vaccine apartheid.

Gordon Brown

The vast majority of the 2.5 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses produced so far have gone to the richest countries. Sub-Saharan Africa has received less than 2 percent. As a result, only 2 percent of the region’s population has had a first vaccine shot, and only 0.2 percent are fully immunized. The Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, Thabo Makgoba, calls this “vaccine apartheid.” And today, with African rates of COVID-19 infection rising by an estimated 25 percent per week, the world’s poorest countries face two problems that perhaps only the G7 can resolve. First, they cannot contain the spread of the disease if they have to wait in a queue this summer and autumn for leftover Western doses, most of which won’t arrive until next year. Second, they cannot reach Western levels of immunization or protect themselves with testing and protective equipment without more financial support: $16 billion more is needed this year, and upward of $30 billion in 2022.
A proposal from the leaders of Norway and South Africa illustrates how the world can raise the needed cash. Their formula takes into account each country’s income and wealth, and the differential benefits they would receive from the reopening of the world economy. Based on their ability to pay, the G7, along with South Korea and Australia, would underwrite 67 percent of the costs. The US would pay 27 percent, Europe 22 percent, the UK 5 percent, and Japan 6 percent, with Canada, South Korea and Australia chipping in 2 percent each. Other G20 countries, including China, Russia, and the oil states, would cover the rest.
But there is, in the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., “such a thing as being too late.” The world needs a decision by the G7 this week, or lives will continue to be lost. The world cannot afford vaccine apartheid.",,"June 11, 2021",Arab News,Vaccines for all or vaccine apartheid?,
2022/0088,Press Release,https://press.un.org/en/2021/ecosoc7039.doc.htm,"With the number of new COVID-19 cases around the world nearly doubling over the past two months — approaching the highest infection rate observed during the pandemic — the unequal distribution of vaccines is not only a moral outrage, but economically and epidemiologically self-defeating, the head of the United Nations health agency told a special ministerial meeting of the Economic and Social Council today.

“Vaccine equity is the challenge of our time,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), told the gathering in opening remarks.  “And we are failing.”

Driving that point home, he reported that, of the 832 million vaccine doses administered, 82 per cent have gone to high- or upper?middle-income countries, while only 0.2 per cent have been sent to their low-income counterparts.  In high?income countries alone, 1 in 4 people have been vaccinated, a ratio that drops precipitously to 1 in 500 in poorer countries.

The meeting — held in virtual format with the theme “A Vaccine for All” — brought together senior officials from the United Nations, Governments, business, the scientific community and civil society.  They explored ways to guarantee equal access to vaccines as a global public good, and strengthen the readiness of countries for their distribution.

The Director-General said that rapidly spreading variants, the inconsistent application and premature easing of public health measures, fatigue with social restrictions and the dramatic inequity in vaccine coverage have all led to an alarming spike in new cases and deaths.  “This is a time for partnership, not patronage,” he emphasized.

“We have the tools to end this pandemic,” he continued.  The Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-Accelerator), created by WHO and its partners, as well as the COVAX Facility, can prevent mistakes of 40 years ago, when the world was slow to deploy life-saving antiretroviral drugs to poor countries during the HIV/AIDS crisis.

Today, COVAX has distributed 40 million doses to 100 countries, but that is nowhere near enough, he said, stressing that WHO had expected to have distributed 100 million doses by now.  Some countries have received nothing, none have received enough, and some are not receiving second-round allocation on time, he noted.  “The problem is not getting vaccines out of COVAX,” he added.  “The problem is getting them in.”

He said WHO is working with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to scale up production and supply.  A COVAX manufacturing task force has been formed, and promisingly, the African Union will form the New Partnership for African Manufacturing, he noted.  It aims to build five vaccine production hubs on the continent, starting with three mRNA facilities in Rwanda, Senegal and South Africa.  WHO is also developing regional regulatory capacity through the African Medicines Agency, he reported.

Calling upon countries with enough vaccine to cover their populations “many times over” to make immediate donations to COVAX, he underlined the vital need to explore every option for boosting production.  They include voluntary licences, technology pools, flexibilities on trade-related intellectual property rights and waiving certain intellectual property provisions, and investing in local vaccine manufacturing.  WHO will continue to provide technical assistance and to add manufacturing bases across Africa, Asia and Latin America, he said.

He urged all countries to carry out measures that work — surveillance, testing, contact?tracing, supportive quarantine and compassionate care — emphasizing that never in the 75-year history of the United Nations has its role been more important.  “We cannot defeat this virus one country at a time,” he stressed.  “We can only do it with a coordinated global effort, based on the principles of solidarity, equity and sharing.”

Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO), described the vaccine disparities as “morally unconscionable”.  Addressing inequity is a task that forces the world to grapple with daunting technical, logistical, policy and political hurdles, but they can be overcome in a practical, empirically informed manner, she said.  While the impulse to conserve supply is understandable, securing personal safety is not enough, she emphasized.  “We must find a way to share.”

A recent WTO vaccine equity event had some encouraging takeaways, she reported, making clear the untapped potential in developing countries to step up production, and the availability of resources to bankroll such investment.  WTO members have reduced export restrictions from 109 in nearly 90 countries, to 51 in 62 countries, she said, adding that, with pragmatic engagement, they can find ways to bridge concerns over intellectual property rights.  She went on to express hope that such efforts will lead to a framework agreement on trade and health, preferably before the twelfth WTO Ministerial Conference in December.

Munir Akram (Pakistan), President of the Economic and Social Council, said that, as well as being a moral imperative, universal vaccine coverage is the only realistic way out of the pandemic.  He called for scaling up production, addressing intellectual property issues, supporting weak health systems, removing export restrictions — and importantly — funding the WHO ACT?Accelerator and COVAX Facility.  Decisive steps towards universal access to vaccines is a prerequisite for economic recovery, he stressed.

Volkan Bozkir (Turkey), President of the General Assembly, emphasized:  “No topic is as relevant or pertinent to the world today as that of vaccines,” while acknowledging:  “Our efforts have not been perfect.”  He stressed that “we must finish what we have started”, pressing Governments to recommit to the principles of human solidarity and cooperation.  The progress made to date is the result of countries working with hundreds of companies and thousands of scientists — “multilateralism at its finest” — he said.

With a view to ensuring the goal of “vaccines for all”, he continued, Member States should extend resources to COVAX; invest in vaccine research, production and distribution; donate vaccines to countries in need; and tackle misinformation to ensure that everyone is educated on the benefits of inoculation.  “It is the job of the United Nations and its Member States to act on these demands,” he stressed.

Throughout the day, ministers and other senior officials explored ways to bridge financing gaps, build national capacities and maximize vaccine supply and rollout, as they engaged in two panel discussions addressing the related problems.

Panel I

Melissa Fleming, Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications, moderated the first panel discussion, on the theme “Scaling up for Vaccine Equity”.  It featured the following panellists:  Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director, Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS); Henrietta Fore, Executive Director, United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF); Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist, World Health Organization (WHO); John Nkengasong, Director, Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention; Paul Farmer, Professor and Chair, Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard University Medical School; and Andrey Zarur, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, GreenLight Biosciences, Incorporated.

Ms. FLEMING, opening the discussion, cited data showing that 9 out of 10 people in poor countries could miss out on vaccines.  She asked the UNAIDS Executive Director to elaborate on the concept of “people’s vaccine” and on ways in which to address vaccine inequality.

Ms. BYANYIMA said rich nations are currently vaccinating their citizens at a rate of one person per second while, as of the week of 4 to 11 April, seven African countries were yet to receive a single dose.  She added that widening inequality — exacerbated by the pandemic — runs counter to the Sustainable Development Goals.  The right to health is a universal human right, she pointed out, emphasizing that it that should not be up for sale or denied due to profit concerns.  Vaccine nationalism or apartheid is self-defeating because it prolongs the crisis, economic downturn and suffering for everyone, she said, stressing that investment in regional vaccine manufacturing hubs is necessary for future global safety.  Noting that vaccine inequality translates into social and economic inequality, she said any delay in response to the current crisis equates to more loss of life and increased poverty.  She added that a global plan is needed to effectively address this issue.

Responding to a question about similarities between the current crisis and the HIV/AIDS one, she reiterated that unequal access to health products, technology and services costs lives and delays overall recovery.  Recalling that treatment for HIV/AIDS initially cost between $10,000 per patient per year, she said the cost fell to $100 per patient per year as a direct result of a global movement pushing for change.  She urged the international community to learn from past crises, avoid previous mistakes and bear in mind that — beyond the moral and economic imperatives to act — “no one is safe until everyone is safe”.

Ms. FORE, asked about vaccine-equity concerns and UNICEF’s role in addressing COVID-19, noted that about half the world’s vaccines have passed through the agency’s doors for the past 20 years.  Children require routine immunizations and must not be neglected while the world vaccinates against COVID?19, she emphasized.  UNICEF moves 2 billion doses of vaccines for children annually, she said, adding that the Fund plans to move another 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines if it has the supply.  To that end, countries must emphasize preparedness for their distribution by developing priorities for who will receive the vaccine first — for example, front-line workers such as doctors, nurses and teachers — and by communicating to their citizens that vaccines are the best protection against COVID-19 and its variants.  She went on to underscore the importance of sufficient manufacturing capacity for supplies that facilitate vaccine distribution, including masks, syringes and safe disposal equipment.

On how to avoid vaccine nationalism, she pointed out that the number of doses administered in low-income countries stands at 0.2 per cent of the population, compared to 16.7 per cent in middle-income countries and 48.7 per cent in high-income ones.  To address that inequality, she called for the removal of import and export restrictions, increased licensing of relevant intellectual property and the loan, release or donation of vaccine supplies by those countries possessing excess supply.

Ms. SWAMINATHAN, answering a query about WHO’s role in pushing for equitable access to vaccines, emphasized that agency’s importance as a normative agency that informed manufacturers of benchmarks for COVID-19 vaccines — including a minimum of 50 per cent efficacy — which regulators then used in assessing vaccine candidates.  She said that, for universal access to be successful, it requires investment in infrastructure, workforce training, transfer of technology and knowledge, a competent regulatory system and willingness to share on the part of the holders of intellectual property-rights holders.

On how to address the health concerns surrounding the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, she pointed out that recent health complications are not unexpected because no drug or vaccine is 100 per cent safe and a certain percentage out of a large pool of recipients will inevitably display rare side effects.  The issue here is one of trust, not only in the vaccines, but also in the authorities disseminating information about them, she stressed.  Authorities must be open and transparent about known facts, and the calculus is ultimately about benefit versus risk.  She added that the risk for all age groups of dying from COVID-19 is far higher than that of dying from a vaccine.

Dr. NKENGASONG, asked about the challenges facing vaccine rollout in Africa, recalled past health crises in which tens of millions on the continent died needlessly.  The international community “should not let history repeat itself”, he emphasized, pointing out that “nice words about solidarity” expressed at the onset of the pandemic disappeared quickly with the arrival of vaccines.  The international community cannot neglect a continent of 1.3 billion people if it is to overcome the present crisis.  Expressing surprise that “basic common sense” has not prevailed in that regard, he invoked Martin Luther King, Jr.’s, appeal to the “fierce urgency of now” in calling for a return to the spirit of cooperation that defined the early days of the present crisis to fight the coronavirus.

Concerning the potential for increased vaccine manufacturing in Africa to solve the current crisis and others like it, he underscored the importance of implementing a framework for reversing the narrative that 99 per cent of vaccines in Africa are imported.  He expressed hope that, in 20 years, Africa will manufacture at least 50 per cent of the vaccines it uses.  That would be in the world’s best interest, he emphasized, calling for partnerships in technology transfer, infrastructure development and regulatory issues in support of the African vision for such manufacturing.

Mr. FARMER, asked how to apply lessons learned during previous health crises, said one of the biggest failures of the response to Ebola in West Africa was low expectations and ambition on the part of imported experts, tinged with a distinctly colonial feel.  The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has carried out excellent work in recent years, he noted, underlining the importance of African-led initiatives.  He emphasized that the delay between the development and use of new tools costs lives, recalling that a vaccine proven effective against Ebola sat on shelves for a decade due to a perceived lack of demand.  The history of medicine and public health in Africa, he added, serves as a reminder that the international community must focus on equitably “irrigating clinical deserts” in order to decolonize global health and respond to COVID-19.

Asked about a road map for a more equitable global health system, he said what is necessary is “not rocket science” — countries need safe spaces to deliver care, systems and support to those in need.

Mr. ZARUR, asked about the role that the private sector can play in scaling up vaccine production and promoting equitable distribution, said that sector has a responsibility — rather than a role to play — to build national capacities for vaccine manufacturing so that Governments can address problems on the local level.  “If you teach someone how to make a vaccine, you vaccinate them forever,” he observed.  The private sector must create a new business model that allows for profitable universal vaccine production, potentially by allowing countries to earn the right — through the licensing of intellectual property — to manufacture their own vaccines and profit from doing so, he said.

Responding to a question about potential challenges faced by developing countries, even if granted licensing and manufacturing rights, he said the biggest such challenge is one of funding.  Although the cost of implementation is miniscule compared to the damage already suffered, human nature would rather spend money on treatment than on prevention, he added.  Calling for the scaling up of education systems, he said the world needs trained operators who, bolstered by the global transfer of technology and skills, can develop the next generation of vaccines for the crises to come.

Dialogue

IBRAHIMA KALIL KABA, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guinea, spoke on behalf of the “Group of 77” and China, emphasizing that COVID-19 vaccines must be treated as a global public good.  Fair, timely and universal access is necessary to overcome the pandemic and recover momentum to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, he said.  He called for increased sharing of technology and information while urging all countries to counter misinformation and vaccine hesitancy.  Pointing out that the global vaccine gap threatens collective health and well?being, he expressed support for scaling up vaccine production under the trade-related intellectual property rights agreement.

ALEXEY TSOY, Minister for Healthcare of Kazakhstan, spoke on behalf of the Group of Landlocked Developing Countries, noting that inequitable access to vaccines is deepening the divide between poor and rich countries.  He called upon relevant stakeholders to refrain from direct, unilateral deals with manufacturers and by donating vaccines to vulnerable countries.  At least 70 per cent of the world’s population must be vaccinated in order to contain the current crisis, according to expert opinion, he said, encouraging the facilitators of COVAX to increase intended procurement.  He also called upon WTO members to use the trade?related intellectual property rights agreement to temporarily increase timely, affordable access to essential medical products.

FRANK ANTHONY, Minister for Health of Guyana, spoke on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), expressing concern regarding the devastating impact of COVID-19 on small, developing States in the form of lockdown measures, supply?chain disruptions, sharp declines in remittances and the general decrease in travel, trade and other economic activity.  Predicting that many vulnerable countries and peoples will continue to suffer unless safe, effective vaccines are made universally available and affordable, he called for increased funding for the ACT-Accelerator and its COVAX Facility, and appealed to international financial institutions to provide low-cost financing to support the pandemic recovery efforts of all developing countries.

The representative of the European Union pointed out that the bloc has spent more than €1 billion to support research on anti-COVID vaccines and therapeutics and has contributed €2.5 billion to the ACT-Accelerator’s COVAX Facility, which has exported more than 80 million doses to 42 countries.  Furthermore, “Team Europe” has mobilized a global recovery package of over €40 billion and will provide a further €100 million in humanitarian support to vaccine efforts, in coordination with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.  He went on to emphasize that vaccination is “not a race between countries, but a race against the virus”.

The representative of Tuvalu, speaking on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum, said the pandemic has affected lives, health care, infrastructure, food security, development goals, trade, tourism, remittances and social cohesion around the globe, including in “our blue Pacific continent”.  He emphasized the need to vaccinate all Pacific peoples in order to mitigate health concerns, improve well-being and facilitate early economic recovery.  Equitable access to vaccines can be “considered a form of stimulus” for Pacific economies.  Noting that the region’s small island developing States have had limited policy space in which to respond to the crisis — particularly lacking the means for extra spending — he called for increased support for health-care infrastructure, investment and training.

DON PRAMUDWINAI, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Thailand, noted that more than half the 9.6 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines secured by countries around the world are concentrated in only 10 of them.  Calling for global efforts to improve vaccine manufacturing and distribution capacities, he said Thailand will serve as a regional manufacturing hub for a viral vector-based vaccine by the second half of 2021, and plans to produce up to 200 million doses annually.  He emphasized that the international community can seize the present moment to turn crisis into opportunity by accelerating achievement of health-related Sustainable Development Goals, such as universal health coverage.

Panel II

Moderated by Juan Sandoval Mendiolea, Deputy Permanent Representative of Mexico to the United Nations and Vice-President of the Economic and Social Council, the panel featured presentations by Seth Berkley, Chief Executive Officer, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; Mamta Murthi, Vice?President for Human Development, World Bank Group; Jorge Moreira da Silva, Director, Development Co-operation Directorate, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD); Miho Shirotori, Acting Director of Trade and Commodities, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD); Jeremy Konyndyk, Executive Director, COVID-Task Force, United States Agency for International Development; Lucas Chancel, co-Director, World Inequality Lab and World Inequality Database, Paris School of Economics; and Chris Lockyear, Secretary-General, Médecins Sans Frontières.

Mr. BERKLEY said the COVAX Facility has delivered 40 million doses to 114 economies — working with Pfizer, AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute in particular — and raised $8.3 billion towards the Advance Market Commitment.  The Facility will be able cover 2 to 3 per cent of the global population by the end of summer, he added.  However, there are supply constraints, intense competition for doses and problems with restrictions on vaccine exports, he said.  Describing the global focus on equitable allocation as a success in itself, he contrasted it with the scepticism of the message “no one is safe until everyone is safe”, a year earlier.  Observing that the emergence of variants has changed minds, he said it has also led to vaccine panic, with countries buying doses from everywhere, including through bilateral agreements, which are inefficient and “not in anybody’s self-interest”.  Governments should instead remove export and import control measures that slow the delivery of vaccines and supplies, he said.  Nor is vaccine diplomacy a health-based approach to sharing, he added, emphasizing that vaccines should be delivered through a multilateral mechanism, such as COVAX.  Equitable allocation would add $9 trillion to the global economy, he noted, warning that, without it, “we’re all going to pay the price”.

Mr. CHANCEL said that meeting the demands by India, South Africa and more than 100 emerging and developing countries for the opening of intellectual property rights would allow scientists to work on tackling the COVID-19 variants, and to trade the best available vaccines.  Calling attention to the European Union’s position in WTO, he said the bloc has blocked most of the emerging world from expanding distribution since October 2020, by limiting private intellectual property rights.  That action contravenes claims by European leaders that access to vaccines should be a global public good, he said, emphasizing:  “Every researcher should have access to formulas developed in 2020,” he said, adding that every company should also have access to the trials and errors of the few pharmaceutical companies that produced the best vaccines to date.  He went on to stress that it is not an efficient approach for the richest nation on earth to keep that information to itself, calling for the “liberation” of all productive capacities on the planet.  The European Union, United States and leaders of high-income countries must meet the demands of India and South Africa as soon as possible, he said.  “This will not cost high-income?country taxpayers money,” he said.  “This really is about expanding the size of possible solutions.”

Mr. MOREIRA DA SILVA, outlining policies to support equitable access to vaccines, said the absence of a global strategy to deploy them in developing countries has caused a crisis, delaying global economic recovery.  “Current efforts are not enough” as demand outstrips supply, he emphasized.  The recent OECD report “Learning from Crisis:  Building Resilience” calls on donors to increase support as inequitable vaccine rollouts threaten to reverse hard-fought progress, he noted.  Frameworks for equitable allocation, notably through COVAX, should be supported.  “We need to make the case for additional development finance,” and at the same time, ensure that support is not diverted from other areas critical for meeting the Sustainable Development Goals, he said.  Sixteen trillion dollars is being spent on domestic recovery packages, while $22 billion is needed to fill the vaccine rollout funding gap, he said, pointing out the need for country-led solutions, the right infrastructure and a solid donation structure for deploying vaccines.

Ms. MURTHI said fair equitable access is among the most urgent priorities today.  While the idea that the pandemic will not end until everyone has safe and effective vaccines is understood, countries face very different odds, she said, emphasizing the importance of access and within countries.  Noting that delays in production and strong demand in high-income nations has deprived poor countries of access, she pressed countries with excess supply to donate doses, notably through the COVAX Facility as a coordinating vehicle.  She called for transparency on the part of countries, suppliers and development partners alike, describing various problems created by the lack of clarity around how much supply has been pre?ordered and how much is available.  She emphasized the importance of reducing both formal and informal export restrictions to encourage the flow of supplies and expand manufacturing capacity.  Turning to equity within countries, she recalled her work assessing vaccine readiness, much of which found that, while countries are ready on a small scale, most must bolster their supply chains and communicate with their populations to reduce vaccine hesitancy, she said, adding that the World Bank is stepping in to support “readiness for deployment” and equitable distribution.

Ms. SHIROTORI, outlining how the global trading system can minimize intellectual property rights barriers, said a transparent and predictable framework is needed to curtail vaccine nationalism, whose proponents call for irregular trade measures, such as banning vaccines outright.  The impact of such measures disproportionately harms low-income countries, she pointed out.  Emphasizing that economic recovery depends on vaccinating large swathes of a country’s population, she cautioned that vaccine nationalism could cost the global economy $1.2 trillion a year.  WTO, for its part, provides members with a legal framework within which to discuss flexibilities in relation to trade agreements.  Noting that members are currently discussing waivers to the trade-related intellectual property rights agreement, she said “the question to ask is not if or how, but when the [trade?related intellectual property rights] waiver will be achieved.”  The waiver is in full compliance with the 2030 Agenda, clearly outlined in Sustainable Development Goal 3, target 3.b, she pointed out, describing waivers as the first step towards realizing a vaccine for all.  From a finance perspective, she said, they boost incentives for private and public investment in infrastructure and productive capacity.  She went on to call for global and regional actions to tackle major bottlenecks faced by developing countries, including their lack of technology and capital, low capacity to uphold standards, weak institutional frameworks, small market size and poor infrastructure.

Mr. LOCKYEAR, agreeing that global vaccine production and supply is struggling to meet global demand, and that the scarcity of tools and vaccines has reinforced disparities, said countries with productive capacity benefit from privileged access.  That must prompt the international community to rethink the global agenda, moving away from the focus on economic efficiency to enabling local capacity in low- and middle?income countries, he said.  To do so, vaccine developers must share their intellectual property and transfer their know-how, giving countries the opportunity to leverage the emergence of mRNA vaccines, which require less capital investment, he added, emphasizing that mechanisms for enabling technology transfer must be transparent and open to multiple manufacturers.  He also called for reducing barriers to increasing production, saying that countries must have new options for surmounting obstacles.  “The bottom line is that we need to truly treat vaccines as a global public good in themselves,” he stressed.

Mr. KONYDYK, outlining how the international community can close the financing gap, recalled that the United States, alongside Gavi, co-hosted an event for investment in the COVAX Facility, aiming to raise $2 billion in the coming months and to boost coverage from 20 per cent of Advanced Market Commitment countries to 30 per cent.  But, there is a long way to go and additional resources must be identified, he said, adding that the United States will continue to support Gavi, making additional contributions to elevate what can be achieved through COVAX.  “We also need money to be routed more strategically”, because funds are indeed available, but not necessarily being routed in the most optimal way, he said, noting that the World Bank has offered $12 billion to support vaccine purchases and that multilateral development banks should do likewise.  Describing bilateral flows as inefficient, he said the power of COVAX and multilateral banks is to consolidate money, sending a signal to companies that they do not have to forge deals with Governments.  “We see COVAX as the most important way of doing that,” he added, also underlining the need to better target gaps in the supply chain.

In the ensuing interactive dialogue, ministers and senior officials outlined the many ways in which their countries are working to vaccinate their peoples and support equitable access to vaccines.  The Minister for International Development of Canada highlighted her country’s strong commitment to the ACT?Accelerator, saying it has provided $940 million to date.  She described equitable access to diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines as “our path to ending the pandemic”.

The Minister for Health of the Russian Federation recalled that his country was the first to develop and register a COVID-19 vaccine, saying it now has three available and launched mass vaccinations in January.  Importantly, the Russian Federation is working to enhance access to the Sputnik V vaccine, producing it both domestically and abroad.  Today, it is available in 60 countries and the Government is completing a procedure to include it for use in emergency situations, he said, adding that his country has made voluntary contributions to United Nations agencies and is working bilaterally to provide personal protective equipment.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Colombia said vaccines are being distributed throughout her country with the aim of covering 70 per cent of the population by the end of the year.  She recalled that, in February, Colombia sponsored a Security Council resolution calling for global access to vaccines.

Other speakers called for urgent action on trade, with the Minister for Internal Relations and Cooperation of South Africa highlighting her country’s joint efforts with India to persuade WTO members to approve an emergency temporary waiver of some intellectual property rights rules so that medical technology transfer can be granted during the pandemic.  That would allow countries to produce vaccines originally produced by other manufacturers, she said, adding that increased production would, in turn, permit direct access to and sharing of technology while enabling procurement.  It would also lower prices and expedite distribution to everyone, everywhere.  “I hope all Member States of the United Nations will support this initiative,” placing people over profits, she said, calling also on the Economic and Social Council to encourage greater action on universal access.  “After all, ECOSOC is an activist Council whose role is to ensure action for development,” she pointed out.

The Minister for Health and Family Welfare of India similarly urged WTO to suspend considerations of intellectual property rights in order to rapidly increase manufacturing.  Pointing out that his country has lived up to the “civilizational ethos of seeing the world as one family”, he said India has developed two vaccines, one indigenously, and both have been granted emergency use authority.  With 20 other candidates in the pipeline, he said, the Government has se",,16 April 2021,United Nations,"Unequal Vaccine Distribution Self-Defeating, World Health Organization Chief Tells Economic and Social Council’s Special Ministerial Meeting",
2022/0089,Article,https://www.banglanews24.com/english/open-forum/news/bd/90416.details,"Undoubtedly, the Covid-19 pandemic has shaken the entire world killing nearly 4 million people and infecting about 130 million across the globe. This pandemic turning into catastrophe has portrayed the vulnerability of most countries irrespective of their economic power and political leadership coupled with healthcare capability. However, after the development of vaccines and the starting of mass inoculation by various countries, it is now coming under control gradually, showing a silver lining of human vibrancy in the near future. But, ironically the affordability in availing the Covid-19 vaccine has created more division and discrimination among rich and poor countries in the heavily polarised world.  

The poor countries are suffering to manage vaccines owing to the shortage of production as well as vaccine monopoly and aggressive nationalism of rich countries. A report reveals that some affluent countries have secured over half of the produced vaccines and they have also ordered more for stockpiling despite possession of 3-9 fold more than their actual needs. In advance, Japan has ordered four times more than their total people while the United States has booked two times more than its population. 

The wealthiest countries comprising only 14 percent of the global population have managed 4.2 billion doses of vaccines whereas the developing and least developing countries (LDCs) holding 86 percent of global population have been able to collect only 670 millions of jabs. If the present trend goes on, then more than 85 poor countries will have to wait until the end of 2023 for significant access to vaccines. This reminds the geopolitical dominance and untold vaccine apartheid policy of few rich but greedy countries downtrodding the the chance of accessing vaccines for poor countries.  

The Coronavirus Resource Centre of Johns Hopkins University on July 2 recorded around 130 million global Covid cases along with about 4 million deaths. Both in case of infection and death, the U.S., India and Brazil are topping in the world. Johns Hopkins reveals more than 3 billion vaccines have been inoculated across the world. Roughly 40 million doses of vaccines are now being inoculated in a day across 200 countries. Researchers within and outside of the WHO estimated 11 billion doses of vaccines required for a 5.5 billion targeted population focusing on a pandemic free safer world.  


Countries in Africa, Asia especially South Asia and Latin America are struggling to collect vaccines. Despite the ongoing hurdle, the good news is rich countries have started donating jabs as a part of their humanitarian commitment and also to show off the soft power of diplomacy targeting geopolitical supremacy.   
 
Bangladesh is also lagging behind in managing and injecting Covid-19 vaccines. So far, the country has managed nearly 15 millions of jabs as a part of business deals with India and China as well as gift items from India, China and the USA. As of June 30, less than 4 percent of the population are vaccinated in Bangladesh and the deal to procure 100 million more jabs by December 2021 is on card. As a continent Africa is in the most backward situation regarding vaccination as it has only administered less than 2 percent of vaccines.      

The globalised world is highly polarised with focus on money matters, power dynamics involving soft power, hard power and smart power, changing trends of geopolitics after the split of the Soviet Union. Today, the European Union (EU) is more divided than united, deviating from its motto of foundation. Now, after cost-benefit analyses, China and the USA as two key leaders are trying to play with the lives of more than 7 billion people. In fact, the polarised world is getting paralised bit by bit with no sign of respite in future.  

Even the corona pandemic has failed to unify the countries to come together against the common devil. The world should come forward forgetting their division and work together to fight the Coronavirus through exchange of vaccines, know-how and technology so that the sense of equality and justice prevails over injustice.  

As the right to health is a basic human rights for all, so is the right to vaccination. The universalisation of justice as to global vaccination is only attainable if the West and the East knot a tie, imbibing the spirit of equity, solidarity and unity echoing the doctrine live and let live. Hope in most occasions prevails over despair. Similarly, the silence of the world will end paving the way for the hustle and bustle again.   

Recently, about 150 faith leaders under the banner of the People's Vaccine Alliance underscored the need for elimination of vaccine nationalism and controlling greed of rich countries towards poor ones. The leaders say access to vaccines should not depend on people's wealth, status and nationality urging to render the sense of brotherhood and sisterhood to ease the persisting Covid-19 crisis. The enhancement of the present 0.7 percent international aid budget allocated by rich countries and their supported organisations towards poor countries and also the cancellation of debts for poor countries can be a way-out to get rid of the incapability in accessing Covid-19 vaccines. Vaccine companies mostly in the USA, China, UK, Russia and India are making billions of dollars as profit but the people in third world countries are destined to suffer and dream of chasing for survival.  
 
To save humanity from the global pandemic, shrinking of discrimination fostering cooperation and shunning individualism are now the demands of time. All international set-ups like the United Nations (UN), the World Health Organization (WHO) and alliance of rich and developing countries must ink a global deal with vaccine manufacturing companies to end the woe of 7 billion people to make the world livable with peace, prosperity, security and justice.

The newest entry to the pandemic lexicon might be “vaccine diplomacy”, with some countries using their jabs to strengthen regional ties and enhance their own power and global status.

In early February, half a million doses of the Chinese Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine arrived in Pakistan, before soon also reaching 13 other countries including Cambodia, Nepal, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe. The Chinese ambassador to Pakistan declared it a “manifestation of our brotherhood”, a sentiment echoed by the Pakistani government. Russia has similarly used its own Sputnik V vaccine to win friends and support, providing access to countries as yet unable to start their own vaccination programmes.

India has been donating supplies of the AstraZeneca/Oxford jabs produced in the country to regional neighbours including Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal, bolstering not only its reputation as a supplier of cheap and accessible vaccines to the global south, but also challenging China’s efforts at regional dominance at a time of heightened tensions between the two countries.

Meanwhile, Israel has reportedly agreed to pay Russia to send the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine to the Syrian government as part of a prisoner exchange deal.

Vaccine diplomacy has also involved efforts to undermine trust in the intentions and efficacy of rival powers. China and Russia have both been accused by governments in Europe and North America of state-backed disinformation campaigns seeking to undermine trust in vaccines produced in those regions. And Russia sent supplies of Sputnik V to Hungary, in a move seen by some as designed to undermine EU unity and credibility.

Europe and North America have been late to the game in providing vaccines to poorer countries and regions. Calls from leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron to donate vaccines to poorer countries, and pledges from the UK to donate surplus supplies have only emerged in recent days.

Strings attached?
In the absence of providing vaccine supplies to poorer countries, some in the west sought to cast doubt on the credibility of Chinese and Russian efforts, presenting them as cynical ploys for diplomatic advantage. You may be getting vaccines, they have been telling the world, but at what cost in your obligations to Russia and China – even as western countries wrap their own international aid in conditions, often involving aspirations for trade deals.

The response to the virus has been embedded in global power and diplomatic wrangles from the very start – from the Trump administration referring to “the Chinese virus” at every turn as part of its wider political and economic struggles with China, to Chinese efforts to use its own success to enhance the legitimacy of strict measures and curbs on political and social freedoms.

Fighting disease has in fact long been used as a means for extending soft power and winning friends. Superpower rivalries for influence through the needle have sometimes even been positive: the success of the smallpox eradication campaign was in part fuelled by the rivalry between the Soviet Union and US. Responding to the Sars epidemic in 2002, China provided assistance and support to affected countries to bolster its global power status, including to Taiwan. This stands in stark contrast to its more tense relationship with Taiwan in this latest epidemic.

Such assistance has tended to accrue the most soft-power influence when aid has been seen as impartial and free from naked self-interest. Before being merged with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, for example, the reputation of the UK’s former Department for International Development (DfID) was in part enhanced by its legally enshrined focus on poverty and its autonomous status. The current round of vaccine diplomacy on all sides is neither.

The prospect of global health becoming a new arena for global power competition and rivalry should worry us all. Whatever benefits may have emerged from such rivalries in the past, they did so through cooperative rivalry. The global response to Covid-19 has thus far tended to be uncooperative and divisive, casting blame or seeking to spread distrust.

The complexities of global health, and the needs of the billions excluded from the benefits of vaccine science and innovation, demand a truly global response. Whether responding to Covid-19 will lead to a more equal partnership for health for all, or reinforce some of the worst instincts displayed during the past year, will determine not only the course of Covid-19, but the impact of the next epidemic to threaten global health, and the ones that follow that.The Conversation

2022/0091,Article,https://www.news18.com/news/india/india-supplies-covid-vaccine-to-bhutan-bangladesh-maldives-strategic-importance-3316178.html,"India’s soft diplomacy has been on display during the Covid-19 pandemic — from supplying medicines like hydroxychloroquine, paracetamol and medical equipment to other countries, to New Delhi kick-starting the supply of Indian-manufactured coronavirus vaccines on Wednesday to neighbouring countries as a goodwill gesture.

A chunk of the vaccines being dispatched to the neighbouring countries is on a grant basis. A consignment packed off from the Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune, with 150,000 doses, was delivered to Bhutan on Wednesday. As far as Bhutan is concerned, trade of essential supplies continued to the neighbour despite Covid-19 lockdowns in 2020.


Meanwhile, 100,000 doses are being dispatched Maldives as well. Subsequently, the government of Maldives will strike a commercial deal with SII for 300,000 vaccines. The total population of Maldives is 500,000, so the Indian-manufactured vaccines will take care of a sizeable population there.



The commitment to Maldives, a crucial Indian Ocean archipelago nation, in the context of the Chinese aggression in the region, was made by the Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla during his visit to Male in November 2020. He had announced that as a close partner and friend, India would accord priority to Maldives for providing vaccines, whenever they were ready.

India has often tried to draw a distinction between the diplomatic gestures of India and China towards neighbouring countries. Case in point being Maldives, a country that has been caught in a debt trap with China in the garb of development projects. India has often stressed that its deals with other countries have no ulterior motive of financial subjugation. The grant of free vaccines adds to that narrative.

Nepal, another crucial neighbouring country whose prime minister is alleged to be showing leanings towards Beijing, has also been promised Covid-19 vaccines from India. It among the six countries whose supplies will be initiated by India on Wednesday.

India and Nepal are in the process of overcoming a period of friction after Nepal issued a revised map with three Indian territories. Even though the boundary issue was not discussed in the recent joint commission meeting, for which Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali travelled to New Delhi, the statement issued talked about the cooperation between the two countries during the pandemic.

It said, “Nepal congratulated India on the remarkable success in production of Covishield and Covaxin vaccines in India and requested for early provision of vaccines to Nepal.” It is significant to note that Nepal prime minister P Sharma Oli made a bizarre statement last year calling the Indian strain of coronavirus more virulent as compared to China or Italy’s. Nepal has also unilaterally stopped the entry of Indians.

While there has been friction with Nepal, there was a period of discomfort with another neighbour Bangladesh as well. But in August 2020, foreign secretary Shringla, during his visit to Dhaka, made a commitment to provide vaccines to the country as a goodwill gesture. In his meeting with his counterpart Masud Bin Momen he had said that Bangladesh will get priority in the Covid-19 vaccine produced by India.

The foreign secretary’s visit was significant since it came after Dhaka’s disapproval and apprehensions over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam. In December 2019, foreign minister Abdul Momen had cancelled his trip to India to express displeasure over the CAA.

While Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina had already raised the matter of NRC in Assam twice with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the CAA debate in Parliament aggravated the situation further. During the debate, while making a case for bringing in the CAA, Home Minister Amit Shah had mentioned Bangladesh, along with Pakistan and Afghanistan, as countries where non-Muslim minorities face persecution. The Sheikh Hasina government took umbrage to this statement. Later Hasina, considered a good friend to India, had called the CAA unnecessary.

As India tried to overcome this period of friction, foreign secretary Shringla, an old Dhaka hand, went to Bangladesh despite a raging pandemic and made the vaccine offer as a goodwill gesture towards the neighbouring country.

Fulfilling this commitment, India will send 2 million free doses of Covishield vaccines to Bangladesh. Subsequently Bangladesh’s Beximco Pharmaceuticals will sign a commercial deal with the SII for more vaccines.

The other countries on the list are Seychelles and Myanmar. After clearances, supplies will also start to Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Mauritius. All deliveries will be done in a phased manner, keeping in view India’s domestic requirements since a phased immunisation process is underway in India as well. With this, India is not only sending a message of neighbourhood first, but is also ensuring that just like the vaccines enhance immunity and prevent infection, India too can enhance goodwill and neutralise influence of China in the region through the gesture.

2022/0092,Article,https://epicenter-nyc.com/vaccine-apartheid-is-literally-going-to-kill-us/,"Vaccine apartheid is indeed upon us. 

Consider a March 22 email to Epicenter from a 69-year-old man in Germany who was ready to fly to New York City: “As you probably know, the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine here in Germany has been incredibly slow and we have not yet received an appointment for our first doses.”

A few weeks later, on April 6, a direct message on Twitter from an immigrant wanting a vaccine for her mother back in Jamaica. No vaccines there either. What to do? 

And just this past weekend, came a plea from the U.S.-based daughter of a Toronto retiree. The mother’s second dose of Moderna isn’t until July and she wants to cross the border to get it earlier. 

Epicenter-NYC, a Queens-based community journalism initiative to help New Yorkers get through the pandemic, has increasingly been hearing from people all over the world in search of a Covid vaccine. The requests come as scary new variants of the virus surge in India, Brazil and other countries. India saw a record 350,000 new cases Sunday (with questions over the accuracy of that count) and Brazil has the second highest-global death toll at 380,000 (second only to the U.S.). Meanwhile, some countries, such as Haiti and Cuba, have no vaccines, and the U.S. has millions of doses it’s not using.  

To serve and cover Queens is to serve and cover the world. That feels especially true now so I sought answers to two basic questions: How did this happen? And what can we do to achieve greater vaccine equity and ubiquity? 

Signs of vaccine apartheid, even within the U.S.’s own rollout, have been around for months. We at Epicenter regularly chronicle the challenges of getting vaccines (see reporting from February, March and April) and how people of color and the elderly disproportionately face obstacles. Admittedly, my interest widened in recent days as the situation worsened in India, my parents’ and in-laws’ homeland. About a half-dozen members of our families had or have the virus; one, my aunt Rini, died. We’ve seen repeatedly that elements of taking the pandemic seriously — symptoms of  Covid, distancing measures, the vaccines themselves — feel theoretical until they become personal. In some ways, this too is at the heart of the problem and contributes to a disjointed response. 

On Sunday, April 26, the Biden administration vowed to help India secure raw materials for the manufacturing of vaccines, along with tests, oxygen, personal protective equipment and medical experts to be deployed. This came after days of Indians and their millions-strong diaspora around the world sounded alarm bells on social media and calls to lawmakers over a humanitarian crisis. 

This crisis continues to threaten the rest of the world, and thus all of us… 

How we got here

“It’s a brutal moment in history,” World Health Organization adviser John Butler told me. 

He goes on to recount the history that got us here: A system of many different vaccines and policies criss-crossing borders, even as the virus does not discriminate. 

Certain countries invest in different technologies, Butler says, and mRNA, the technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, is new. Both mRNA vaccines are built on decades of federally funded research, and a half-dozen or so others (including Moderna) also received funding from what the Trump administration called Operation Warp Speed. 

How those vaccines were developed and why some countries got vaccines and others did not are best summarized in the following articles: 

Vanity Fair’s April 6 piece headlined, “‘We Are Hoarding’: Why the U.S. Still Can’t Donate COVID-19 Vaccines to Countries in Need”

Key excerpt: 

The contracts the Trump administration signed with the vaccine manufacturers prohibit the U.S. from sharing its surplus doses with the rest of the world. According to contract language Vanity Fair has obtained, the agreements with Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen state: “The Government may not use, or authorize the use of, any products or materials provided under this Project Agreement, unless such use occurs in the United States” or U.S. territories.

And this earlier March 10 piece from the Washington Post Opinion section: “Poor countries may not be vaccinated till 2024. Here’s how to prevent that.”

Key excerpt: 

We are in the middle of another global health emergency. Two-thirds of WTO members back waiving patent rules during the pandemic, but the United States and others argue that patents are critical for innovation and are not slowing the global supply of vaccines. Neither is true. First, patents played little, if any, role in stimulating the “warp speed” development of Covid-19 vaccines. The Moderna vaccine was almost entirely funded by the U.S. government, with an additional $1 million donated by Dolly Parton. It is inappropriate for a private company to monopolize technology funded by taxpayers. Moderna itself recognizes this, having previously announced that it will not seek to enforce its vaccine patents.

I interviewed the op-ed’s co-author Madhavi Sunder, associate dean for international and graduate programs and law professor at Georgetown University Law Center, to find out more. Due to its origins in government funding, she says Moderna is known as “the people’s vaccine” and said U.S. taxpayers have the right to demand it gets shared with the rest of the world. 

The ingredients are less an issue than Twitter might be focusing on—but there is a key area where the U.S. could be helping more. “There are certainly supply chain problems. I don’t think those are insurmountable,” she said. “The harder problem is the issue of patents and tech transfer. In order to get a patent a company details how to make this invention. Unfortunately, drug companies have gotten good at being obscure about that description.”

Indeed, mRNA represents a new frontier of knowledge sharing, thus confounding governments. “With mRNA, it’s not enough to make the patent available,” she said. “It’s critical to share the know-how, the technology about how to make the vaccines safely and effectively.”

Drug companies are licensing to manufacturers where they are ensured there is a population who will eventually pay for those vaccines. But Sunder said, “most of the world cannot afford to pay. Incentives to private companies won’t be enough here—there is no incentive for them to make more vaccines for people who cannot pay. This is why we need the government, here, the Biden Administration, to say, ‘Hey, we paid for these vaccines, and our publicly-funded research is critical to your vaccines. You must share the technology with global manufacturers so we can safely end this pandemic as soon as possible.’”

Favoring those who can pay for the vaccine has a potentially deadly impact on those who can’t. It means those who can’t pay move to the back of the line, which could take years before they access a vaccine. “We are holding the knowledge hostage,” Sunder said. “We’re not supposed to use patents in that way. It violates international law. It violates morality.”

The undercurrent of all this is the “America First” mindset of the last administration—an illogical strategy against a virus that does not discriminate. But this crisis has been decades, even centuries, in the making. 

Policies rarely keep pace with people; their movement from one land to another was the defining characteristic of the 20th century, resulting in families and companies as borderless as the virus. While politicians might talk about taking care of their own populations first, for many of us, our loved ones are here and there (and perhaps a few other places, too). There’s no breathing easy until they can. The nature of a truly global diaspora and workforce does not feel captured in rhetoric around vaccine equity and distribution. If you want to see your grandmother again or grab a bulgogi burger at McDonald’s in Korea, we need to commit to the idea of everyone in the world being worthy of a Covid vaccine.Indeed, the back-and-forth of immigrant populations also affects vaccine hesitancy. On Friday, April 23, Epicenter hosted a table at Diversity Plaza in Jackson Heights to help book our neighbors for vaccines and answer questions. An Egyptian man stopped by and presented his dilemma: He received his vaccine already and a two-month trip to Egypt to see family is imminent. His son, age 17, had not yet gotten the vaccine and can only get the Pfizer vaccine due to his age. We offered to schedule the teen in New York City, easily. But what about dose 2? When we told the father it didn’t look like Pfizer was available in Egypt and we were really recommending not messing with the timing on that second dose, he walked off. He said his son would just get the vaccine when he returns to the U.S. 

Certainly Russia and China—and their respective vaccines—are engaging in a certain diplomacy via their shots, ubiquitous in much of the developing world. By selling or donating the vaccines, despite initial questions over their efficacy and transparency, the two countries are unmistakably gaining goodwill. A woman in the Middle East recently told me she and her friends prefer to wait to get Pfizer, although it’s more expensive and harder to get. Headlines of the global elite taking “vaccine vacations” to Dubai abound. 

What you can do

Give money to Covax
Some news we break: The World Health Organization plans to announce a fundraising campaign Wednesday, April 28, to fill “the growing vaccine gap between countries who can afford Covid-19 vaccines and those that can’t, and a desire by people everywhere to know what they can do to help end the pandemic.”

The campaign, called Go Give One, allows individuals, companies, charities and others to raise money for the global vaccine fund, known as Covax. While Covax, whose most famous backer is Bill Gates, has come under fire for favoring paying for the vaccines versus giving them (or the knowledge needed to make them) away, it is possible to donate to Covax even as you fight for the right of countries to make or access their own vaccines. 

Here’s a good primer on Covax, from the Associated Press. Key excerpt: 

Covax is only planning to provide enough vaccines to immunize about 20% to 30% of people in poorer countries — a figure that will still leave those nations vulnerable to coronavirus outbreaks. Experts estimate that at least 70% of a population needs to be protected against Covid-19 to prevent future epidemics.

Kate Elder of Doctors Without Borders called Covax’s first vaccine delivery to Ghana “a very small, late start” to global immunization. The charity suggested postponing vaccine shipments to rich countries  “while the world works to catch up on protecting the most at-risk people living in developing countries.”

Talk to your family about vaccines.
No question, there’s vaccine misinformation spreading, sometimes from world leaders themselves. Immigrant communities, while often guilty (Exhibit A: the family WhatsApp group), also represent an opportunity to leverage networks to spread facts. One of our volunteers at Epicenter says he believes Brazilian immigrants in the U.S. better understood the need to get vaccines when they saw how bad things in their homeland were getting and how lucky they felt to be able to access them. 

As we have seen in the U.S., who chooses what vaccine depends on what they have heard about it and the experience of their friends and family. Serbia, for example, has access to many of the vaccines, and WHO’s Butler says it’s common to go with the familiar: “If lots of people’s friends got a particular vaccine, whether it be Chinese, American, Russian or from elsewhere, that is a major deciding factor on the choices people make.”

The word of mouth among families is strong and trusted. I have been sharing this one-sheeter from Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist in New York, on my own family and friend WhatsApp groups and social media. Vet and give to these India-focused charities. 
Longtime public-relations veteran Lavanya DJ compiled this list of donation options in India, which has been growing every day. I asked her what prompted the list and she said, “I’ve known donating to Indian organizations is hard because of my experience trying to support Indian media outlets. Every time I find a publication that accepts international credit cards I share it on my Instagram. I figured as more people start to learn about the situation in India they will want to help and it’s not going to be easy.”

Help beyond India. 
India’s own vulnerable population, and indeed, the rest of the world, are relying on Indian vaccine production so the Biden announcement is indeed significant. India has long been known as “pharmacy to the developing world” as one of the most prolific producers of inexpensive medicines for low- and middle-income countries. 

Every day is bringing worrisome news from Brazil, Peru, Bangladesh, Indonesia and others. Still other countries are saying their vaccine shipments are delayed, or nonexistent. We’re a global, interdependent economy and need to act like it. 

Join Epicenter, in partnership with ScrollStack, for a special livestream on Tuesday night at 9 pm EST (6:30 a.m. in India) as we try to get a better pulse on the ground and ways we can help other countries, too. Georgetown’s Sunder calls donations “a drop in the bucket” and advocated for more sustainable solutions to help countries vaccinate entire populations. “You teach them how to make the vaccines around the world and that helps neighboring populations and is empowering them to care for themselves.”

The inequities are hardly limited to just vaccines. This imbalance in global healthcare, of course, applies to heart disease or cancer, but even simpler diseases to treat or prevent. The World Health Organization is clear on this: “People living in a low-income country are far more likely to die of a communicable disease than a noncommunicable disease.”

Reach out to your elected officials to demand the healthcare system   you want. Says Butler: “I think health was seen as a cost and now it will be much more fundamental and foundational to everything we do.

“We already pay for this out of our taxes. And then we end up paying twice,” Butler said. “People get sucked into thinking, ‘The only way to finance innovation is high prices.’ That is not the case in these vaccines.”",https://i0.wp.com/epicenter-nyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nitin-2.jpeg?resize=800%2C593&ssl=1,"April 26, 2021",Epicenter NYC,Vaccine apartheid is literally going to kill us,

Raka Banerjee: Hello, and welcome to The Development Podcast coming to you from the World Bank Group in the United States and around the world. I'm Raka Banerjee alongside Paul Blake.

Paul Blake: Today, the race to vaccinate the world against COVID-19. We're examining why many low-income countries are struggling to vaccinate their populations and what's being done to help.

Mamta Murthi (Clip): The situation that we see right now is absolutely unacceptable because a large part of the world remains unvaccinated, and this is a danger for all of us.

Paul Blake: And from Addis Ababa, the steps being taken to accelerate vaccination rates across the African continent.

Ahmed Ogwell (Clip): What we want are vaccines now. We don't want vaccines in 2022, 2023. And those vaccines that would be made available now have already been bought up. It means that even though we have the money, we can't be able to buy because there's nothing to buy.

Paul Blake: All that and more over the next few minutes, but first let's take a look at some data.

Paul Blake: All right, Raka. So you've been digging into the data and when it comes to COVID-19 vaccination rates around the world, what are you finding?

Raka Banerjee: So I was looking at data that's available from the Our World in Data website, which is updated daily based on the latest official statistics from governments and health ministries around the world. And what has become painfully clear is that the main story when it comes to vaccines is inequality.

Paul Blake: And what are some of those sort of major discrepancies?

Raka Banerjee: So worldwide, almost 4 billion vaccine doses have been administered globally. And 27.6% of the world's population has received at least one dose of a vaccine at this point. So that sounds pretty good. But then if you break it down by country income groups, 1.1% Of people living in low income countries have received even one dose of a vaccine.

Paul Blake: And 1.1% Is a very low number. Can you break it down and further?

Raka Banerjee: So that's in terms of percentage of population, but then if you look at the breakdown when it comes to the percentage of doses to date, and this is as of July 28th, 84% of all doses that have been administered so far have all gone to people in high and upper middle-income countries. And in comparison, looking at the percentage of doses that have been administered in low-income countries, it's a shockingly low 0.3%.

Paul Blake: I mean, that's a huge difference. Do things look any better if you start to compare across regions?

Raka Banerjee: Honestly, not really. So in terms of doses administered per every 100 people, Europe and North America come in at 84 and 82 doses respectively, and keep in mind that most of the vaccines are two dose regimens, right?

Paul Blake: Right.

Raka Banerjee: And then right from there, it drops really starkly. So South America has administered only 59 doses per 100 people, Asia 54, and then across Africa the rate is fewer than five doses for every 100 people.

Paul Blake: And is it a question of problems with production or with making the vaccines? Or is this an issue with doses being sort of held in surplus and not being made available to people who need them in other locations? And I guess if it's about that second point, like excess doses, where are they and why aren't they being released?

Raka Banerjee: So a big part of the problem is that many wealthy countries actually pre-ordered far more vaccine doses than they even needed to vaccinate their populations. Looking at data coming from Duke University, just for example, the US paid for enough vaccines for twice its population, the UK paid for enough for four times its population, and Canada for five times its population. So even though the world will have created 11 billion total doses by the end of this year, almost 9.9 billion of those doses have already been promised to higher and upper middle-income countries.

Paul Blake: And so what's happening now in countries where the vaccine supply exceeds the demand for the vaccine?

Raka Banerjee: Well, some countries have started to donate some of their excess supply, but it's hard to find data on exactly what's happening. Last month, the G7 agreed to donate 1 billion COVID-19 doses to poorer countries, so that's a start. But given that the World Health Organization has stated that vaccinating most of the world's population will take 11 billion doses, a lot of people have felt that this contribution was not nearly as substantial enough to make the difference that we need to actually stop the pandemic.

Paul Blake: And you mentioned that it was hard to find data around excess doses. Do you have any thoughts about why that is? Why it's hard to find data? Is it a matter of the research not being done? Is it a matter of sort of transparency? What's behind that?

Raka Banerjee: Well the thing is when it comes to data, it's so important to have transparency so that people can hold governments to account. And since much of this information is not publicly available, it's really hard to advocate for the equitable distribution that is really needed to make sure that people in poorer countries aren't just being left to fend for themselves.

Paul Blake: All right. So one last question. Is vaccine production a factor here? And is there any good news on that front in terms of getting shots into arms?

Raka Banerjee: So many of the major vaccine manufacturers have ramped up production. So for example, Pfizer and BioNTech are planning to produce 3 billion doses by the end of the year. And a third of those are intended to go directly to COVAX or low and middle-income countries.

Paul Blake: All right. Well, thanks so much for sharing all this background and context. Really appreciate it.

Raka Banerjee: My pleasure. Thanks, Paul.

Raka Banerjee: This is The Development Podcast from the World Bank Group.

Paul Blake: Now, March 2020 may feel like it was a different era, but it was just about 17 months ago that the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. With developing countries bracing for the virus to arrive on their shores, one region that was of particular concern was Africa. Many countries across the continent have long suffered from fragile health systems that were already stretched by outbreaks in years past.

Raka Banerjee: To understand how African countries were pulling together and preparing for the pandemic. We spoke last year to the Africa Centers for Disease Control's Deputy Director, Dr. Ahmed Ogwell.

Ahmed Ogwell (Clip from March 2020): The mood I would say is one of uncertainty because this thing is new, what images available online, and the media is not very encouraging. And of course there's quite some anxiety what that mean if it came onto the continent.

Paul Blake: Well, that was March 2020. Let's fast forward to today. Just what has the virus meant for the continent? What about vaccination efforts and what challenges are on the horizon

Raka Banerjee: To get answers to these questions and more, we had the opportunity to talk once again with Dr. Ahmed Ogwell. He joined us down the line from Addis Ababa.

Paul Blake: Well, thank you so much for joining us. When we last spoke, which was in early March of 2020, before I think much of the world realized just how serious this pandemic was going to be, we asked you how serious the pandemic seemed at the time to you and what those kinds of early signs look like to you in your kind of professional opinion relative to previous outbreaks of diseases. And let's just, real quick before we jump into some questions, take a listen to that clip.

Ahmed Ogwell (Clip from March 2020): This one is looking a lot more serious than the earlier ones. If you look at COVID-19, it's transmissibility is quite high. It's easy to transmit from person to person. And then the level of illness that it causes particularly to the older folk is quite much higher than what SARS and MERS has shown us to be able to do.

Paul Blake: So that was a really prescient answer there from early March 2020. How has the African continent fared since then?

Ahmed Ogwell: There are three things that I think stand out for us on the continent, and thank you very much for having me on the show.

Paul Blake: My pleasure.

Ahmed Ogwell: The three things. One is that when knowledge is shared with the public, they tend to respond largely in positive ways. And that is-

Ahmed Ogwell: ... largely in positive ways. And that is why, in the beginning of the pandemic, we saw low numbers in Africa, not just because there was leadership from many levels, the Africa Union, the Africa CDC, the member states, but also because the public listened to evidence and science and they responded. Second, is that when the chips are really down, that Africa is on its own and we've struggled to handle things that will have been a lot easier if there was more solidarity globally. Third, is the spread of the virus does not really respect modeling. It does not respond to discussions amongst the professionals and politicians. It does what it does, and that's how the variants have ripped across the world. We knew variants were coming, but we were not entirely prepared globally speaking. We were not entirely prepared for the large number of variants. And of course, Delta variant just waking up and becoming the real problem really during the whole pandemic so far.

Raka Banerjee: When we spoke last, you had said that one of your main concerns at that time was that across the continent of Africa, health systems are not the strongest, that they might be overwhelmed. Where those fears realized to any extent, or can you give us an update on that?

Ahmed Ogwell: Africa is very diverse and there are parts of Africa that the systems were not completely overrun, but heavily stretched. It really is heavily dependent on how much prevention and the community engagement our country does because that then reflects on not the overall numbers of cases, and then the numbers of those that really need hospitalization. And those that need hospitalization are the ones that would put a huge strain on the health system. And the knock-on effects include other areas, malaria, TB, childhood illnesses, will then get affected because the staff are quite stretched.

Ahmed Ogwell: But sitting back and looking out to the whole continent as one block, we are very pleased that we, our systems on the continent have not been overrun. Although we are getting low numbers, we are getting slightly more people dying, and this is not a situation that we will have liked. We know why. Three main things come out of that. One, is that we have few health facilities that can be able to handle really serious illnesses. Second, is all the equipment and consumables needed, particularly oxygen concentrators, oxygen machines themselves, ICU facilities, those are few on the continent. And finally, it is because our health workers are also few. And so they are stretched in between looking after relatively more individuals who need that care, but our health systems have not been overrun. And it is something that we are trying to keep that way in the next month as we roll out a vaccination on the continent.

Paul Blake: And that's the very next point I want to go to. You're the expert here certainly much more than me, but I would assume another factor would be the relatively low vaccination rate across African countries and across much of the developing world, but many African countries have very low vaccination rates right now. And I'm wondering what, in your view, is causing those vaccination rates to fall so far behind other countries around the world, and in particularly more developed countries and what needs to be done?

Ahmed Ogwell: There are a few things, factors, that are contributing to the very low vaccination rates. In fact, as of today, we are at about 1.65% fully vaccinated, which is extremely far when you consider our target of 60% of the population on the continent.

Raka Banerjee: [crosstalk 00:13:35] I'm sorry. That's across the whole continent? 1.65% across across the African continent?

Ahmed Ogwell: Correct, fully vaccinated.

Paul Blake: We're-

Raka Banerjee: [crosstalk 00:13:43] Fully vaccinated.

Paul Blake: And fully vaccinated, yeah. And just for anyone who's listening in the future, we're recording this on July 28th, in late July. So data as of July 28.

Ahmed Ogwell: That's correct. So a few factors are contributing to the low vaccination. One, is that there are a few entities that are actually manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines. And particularly those that have achieved emergency use authorization. There are few that are doing that. While, at the same time, the whole world wants the vaccines. So access is heavily limited by the rate of supply of the vaccines. Second, is that the relativity well to do countries bought up the vast majority of the vaccines that are to be made available during this year, because what we want are vaccines now. We don't want vaccines in 2022, 2023. And those vaccines that could be made available now have already been bought up. And in that way, it means that even though we have the money, we can't be able to buy because there's nothing to buy. And we are negotiating very hard with the manufacturers to see if we can be able to get some of these items earlier.

Ahmed Ogwell: So this second. Third, is vaccine nationalism. Even those that we had agreements with to supply, governments have gone into the very unhelpful policy path of keeping everything that is being manufactured within their borders. And this is, in our view, a very negative path to take because it actually continues to keep the whole world at risk because if you don't cover equitably, then the variants will pop up. And those variants, as Delta has shown us, does escape the current vaccines that we have, and that means another. We may need booster doses in the future.

Ahmed Ogwell: And then finally, is the whole area of vaccine hesitancy. This has contributed to some parts of Africa, not the most, but some parts of Africa. Although they have the vaccines, the uptake has been a bit low and slow, and we are working with our communications colleagues to ensure that we are doing good community engagement so that that hesitancy can drop and uptake can be able to increase.

Raka Banerjee: Do you worry about African countries being left further behind going forward? And what do you see as some of the consequences of that?

Ahmed Ogwell: Yes, we are very concerned that the slow pace may leave Africa behind. And the consequences of that, we're already seeing them. When we are told that you can't go to certain public places in certain countries, unless you show a vaccine evidence that you've been vaccinated. And yet, we don't have the vaccines to be able to vaccinate. So this is already an immediate consequence. It means I will not be able to take a holiday, for example, in certain parts of the world because it will be difficult to be able to move around without vaccination.

Ahmed Ogwell: Apart from that is the risk and the very, very high risk that if we do not vaccinate enough and bring the pandemic under control, the new variants we will pop up. And finally, is the risk of our health systems getting overwhelmed if we allow for the numbers to increase. And this is something that really, really keeps us awake at Africa CDC are trying to support our countries to keep the numbers low. If the numbers go high, we know that our health systems will be in real trouble. And in that situation, we will end up with a very, very messy situation, which we are working very hard to avoid.

Paul Blake: Dr. Ahmed Ogwell, thank you so much for taking the time this morning.

Raka Banerjee: Thank you so much.

Ahmed Ogwell: Pleasure.

Raka Banerjee: Such a pleasure.

Ahmed Ogwell: Thank you.

Raka Banerjee: Amid the confusion and devastation of the pandemic, one thing is clear. Vaccines are our most effective tool to stop the outbreak, save lives, and return to normalcy.

Paul Blake: While the Herculean work of scientists to develop safe and effective vaccines so quickly was a massive success. The distribution of vaccines, especially to the developing world, has been rocky and uneven.

Raka Banerjee: Why is this the case and what is being done to boost vaccination rates among the poorest and most vulnerable? We spoke to Mamta Murthi, the World Bank's Vice President for Human Development, who joins us down the line from her home in the Washington DC area. So today, about a year and a half into the pandemic, wealthy countries have the vast majority of the world's supply of COVID-19 vaccines. And in contrast, low-income countries are struggling to even obtain doses for their most at-risk citizens. How can we close this divide in vaccine rollout between rich and poor countries?

Mamta Murthi: So thanks Raka, that's a great question. The situation that we see right now is absolutely unacceptable. Because a large part of the world remains unvaccinated. And this is a danger for all of us. I can see at least four things that need to happen. First of all, we need to increase the supply of vaccines in the short term, there simply aren't enough vaccines for everyone. The second thing is that the vaccines that do exist have been pre-purchased and pre-committed to countries that have more than enough to vaccinate their populations. So we need to release these doses from surplus countries and give them to countries that don't have enough doses. The third thing that needs to happen is that countries need to gear up and be ready to vaccinate people. And there's a bit of chicken and egg here. Countries will be ready if they know they're going to receive vaccines. And finally, the fourth thing is we need greater transparency around how many doses can be manufactured, who are these committed to, where are the surplus doses, so that we can have reallocation towards countries that need those doses.

Paul Blake: And, Mamta, what is the World Bank doing to help in all this?

Mamta Murthi: So we're actually doing quite a lot. First of all, on the manufacturing side, IFC is supporting manufacturing of vaccines, medical equipment, and PPE. In fact, the largest investment in the history of IFC has been in Aspen pharmaceuticals in South Africa, which has just started rolling out Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccines. The second thing we're doing is we're helping countries with financing and technical assistance so that they can buy and administer vaccines to their populations. We've already committed over four and a half billion dollars in over 50 countries to assist with the purchase and deployment. To give you some examples. There are already 50 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines that have been contracted using World Bank financing. World Bank financing will also allow countries in Africa to pay for 400 million doses that the African union has arranged. Another thing that we're doing, the third thing we're doing is we're helping countries with readiness, getting ready to administer and deploy vaccines. And the fourth and final thing we're doing is, along with many others, we're advocating for the release of surplus doses. In fact our president, president Malpass along with the heads of the IMF, WTO, and WHO, are jointly leading a task force, a COVID-19 war room if you like, to accelerate the delivery of vaccines and drugs and therapeutics to developing countries.

Paul Blake: So it sounds like it's a very complicated issue and there's a lot of factors at play, but two that seemed to stand out is that there's a lack of vaccine supply, and there's a lack of effective distribution. When you really dive into the data, what's the real issue behind the vaccine rollout? Which one is the most urgent, which one is causing the most problems?

Mamta Murthi: I would say it's both. It's a shortage of supply. Without a doubt. There aren't enough vaccines being produced, and the production is not equitably distributed. The second thing I would say is that countries still need to gear up for rolling out these mass vaccination campaigns. Just to underline the point, most developing countries are used to vaccinating their child population. The COVID-19 vaccine is a vaccine that will have to be administered at scale to a very large number of adults. Most developing countries vaccinate their children against childhood diseases, measles, mumps, rubella, that kind of thing. They're not used to vaccinating their adults. So there's a lot of preparation that is involved in such a large scale vaccination campaign. And so it's extremely important that countries are ready for this. As the World Bank we've been working with WHO, Gavi, UNICEF and others, on readiness assessments. If you like this as a cheat sheet, it's a list of things that countries have to think about in order to be ready for a large-scale vaccination campaign. And we've worked in over 140 countries to help governments complete these assessments. And these have identified specific gaps that countries need to work on in order to be ready for a large vaccination campaign. I think in terms of having a plan for vaccination, most countries are ready. And also having security systems, I think 80% of countries are ready. But in terms of training vaccinators, about one third of countries still need to do a lot more work, and over half of countries still need to work on stakeholder engagement and communication to address vaccine hesitancy.

Raka Banerjee: I think you had mentioned that the supply for 2021, a lot of it has already been pre-purchased by wealthier countries, and it seems like many of these rich countries already have more than enough vaccine to vaccinate their population, a couple of times over even. And I know that the World Bank has been encouraging countries to donate their excess doses, can you speak to the consequences if they don't?

Mamta Murthi: Well, if we're not able to vaccinate everybody in the world soon, we could be in a situation where the pandemic is prolonged. We're already one and a half years into the pandemic. This could go on for longer and it would affect the global economic recovery. We could be in a situation where the world is not recovering, so global economic growth could be lower. And this has consequences, there are fewer jobs, there's less income in the hands of people. And this affects the ability of people to live comfortably and take advantage of the opportunities that exist. We also run the danger of the emergence of mutations as the pandemic is prolonged and the virus circulates amongst newer populations. And this means that we are all at danger of being victim to a new mute mutation that actually escapes the immunity that is being provided by vaccines.

Raka Banerjee: In terms of looking at this more regionally, it seems that African countries are facing some of the greatest challenges in accessing and distributing COVID-19 vaccines. Their vaccination rates are shockingly low in Africa, relative to other parts of the world. What is the world bank doing to help in Africa specifically?

Mamta Murthi: So vaccination rates in Africa are extremely low, around 1% of the population has been vaccinated, compared to 40% of the population in high-income countries. As the World Bank, we are doing a lot. First of all, IFC is supporting manufacture of vaccines in Sub-Saharan Africa. The second thing we're doing is supporting African countries with financing to both purchase and deploy vaccines. I talked about over four and a half billion dollars that we have committed in over 50 countries. Well, half of these countries are in Africa.

Mamta Murthi: ... and in over 50 countries. Well, half of these countries are in Africa. The third thing we're doing is we are, our financing. We're working with the African Union so that our financing can be used to purchase 400 million doses that the African Union has managed to secure from Johnson & Johnson. And so this means that the World Bank's financing will support the vaccination of 400 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa. We're doing a lot, both on vaccination, but also beyond vaccination on strengthening health systems, helping Africa become more resilient to climate change and supporting jobs and economic transformation in Africa.

Paul Blake: I also understand there's a COVID-19 taskforce that the bank is teaming up with a number of other partners, the IMF, the WTO, the WHO. Can you tell us exactly what that is and what it hopes to accomplish?

Mamta Murthi: So the taskforce, as you mentioned, is joint with three other agencies. And the whole purpose is to track, coordinate and accelerate the delivery of vaccines and diagnostics and therapeutics to low-income countries. The challenge that everyone is facing is this lack of transparency around exactly what the supply is, what has been committed and when it will be delivered. So one of the first things the taskforce committed to do is to have a website and a country dashboard, which would identify specific gaps, initially in the delivery of vaccines, but over time, in the delivery of diagnostics and therapeutics. This would make it easy for everyone to see exactly where the shortages are, where the critical bottlenecks are. And the intention is to bring this to the attention of national authorities and other stakeholders so that the critical bottlenecks can be addressed. The second thing that the taskforce is doing is advocating for very ambitious targets when it comes to vaccination. It's advocating for vaccinating 40% of the population in developing countries by the end of this calendar year, and 60% by the middle of next calendar year. It's also advocating for donations of vaccines. It's actually called for a donation of a billion doses this calendar year, in order to meet this ambitious target of 40% of populations of developing countries to be vaccinated. The third thing it's doing is it's arguing for filling any financing gaps that are getting in the way of vaccinating people in developing countries, including financing gaps in the ACT accelerator. And finally, it's advocating for removing any supply constraints and export restrictions that may be getting in the way of delivery of vaccines, drugs, and therapeutics. It's a joint advocacy come data transparency effort, which is intended to really move the dialogue and accelerate the delivery of these critical tools to developing countries.

Raka Banerjee: You spoke about the transparency, and I've been hearing criticism about the lack of transparency that's there right now in terms of the vaccine contracts between governments, pharmaceutical companies, and the organizations that are part of the vaccine production and delivery. Can you just speak a little more to why transparency is so important in this process?

Mamta Murthi: So, greater transparency is absolutely essential for equitable access. Countries and manufacturers need to be transparent about what has been committed to whom by when. Because once there's clarity on this, then they can be clarity on how much supply is available for discussion, for negotiation, for redirection, towards the parts of the world that really needed. Without this clear picture, it's very hard to be certain that we can move supplies to developing countries and reach the target of 40% by the end of the calendar year. Similarly, complete transparency around the supply chain. Supply chains for vaccines are very complicated. Complete transparency around these supply chains will actually help identify where the critical bottleneck is, which is getting in the way of production and delivery of vaccines or drugs or therapeutics. And then bringing this to the attention of the relevant authorities can help with the bottleneck being removed. Without this transparency, I would say that it's actually very hard to get to this objective of equitable access. And as a part of walking the talk, as the World Bank, we've decided to be completely transparent about what we're doing. We have created a portal that anybody can access to see what our financing is going into. This is available by country.

Raka Banerjee: Thank you so much for being with us. Really appreciate your thoughts on all of this.

Mamta Murthi: Thanks for having me. It was great to talk.

2022/0094,Report,https://wellcome.org/reports/addressing-covid-19-vaccine-inequity-mid-2022,"Across the world, there are unacceptable disparities in access to Covid-19 vaccines, leaving many vulnerable people unprotected. This paper considers this challenge and sets out the action needed by G20 countries and vaccine manufacturers to rapidly increase global vaccination rates, with the aim of reaching 70% of the population in every country by June 2022.  
Key findings
The rollout of Covid-19 vaccines has been highly inequitable, with many more people in high-income countries receiving vaccinations than in low-income countries. If the vaccines delivered to date had been equitably distributed globally, all front-line health workers and vulnerable people would now be protected.

Between now and June 2022, we propose the following actions by G20 countries and vaccine manufacturers to ensure that supply is equitably distributed and is matched with critical support for delivery so that doses reach the arms of the people that need them most.

Redistribute existing supply
G20 countries with high vaccination coverage should accelerate and increase dose donations to COVAX to ensure 40% coverage in every country by the end of 2021.
G20 countries with high vaccination coverage should swap places with COVAX in vaccine supply queues so that manufacturers can fulfil existing COVAX agreements more quickly.
Equitably allocate future supply
Vaccine manufacturers and G20 countries should allow COVAX first right of refusal on a significant proportion of new supply until the end of 2022, to avoid restricted supply going to the same group of wealthy nations.
Vaccine manufacturers, supported by G20 countries, should facilitate increased production by offering or increasing comprehensive, non-exclusive licensing of intellectual property and technology transfers to additional manufacturers.
Support vaccine delivery
G20 countries should support rapid mobilisation of easily accessed funds for Covid-19 vaccine delivery, including direct investment in the ACT Accelerator.",https://cms.wellcome.org/sites/default/files/styles/banner_hi/public/2021-10/Bangladesh-Covid-19-Covax-vaccine-delivery.jpg?itok=-1lMtOjh,25 October 2021,Wellcome,Addressing Covid-19 vaccine inequity by mid-2022,
2022/0095,Press Release,https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/campaigners-petition-un-investigate-racial-and-gender-discrimination-global-covid-19,"An international coalition of human rights law groups, public health experts, and civil society organisations is taking legal action against the US, UK, Germany, Norway, and Switzerland, on the grounds that these countries are in violation of international human rights law by failing to intervene on what has been an inequitable and racially discriminatory rollout of the vaccine and other COVID healthcare technologies. 

In an appeal to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), the coalition charges that by failing to lift intellectual property barriers on all COVID-19 medical technologies through a TRIPS waiver (or to effectively implement it through technology transfers), the US, UK, Germany, Norway, and Switzerland are in violation of the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, a human rights convention ratified by nearly all countries in the world. 

Because the rich countries currently making and hoarding vaccines are majority white, and the formerly colonized countries suffering due to vaccines being withheld are majority Black, indigenous, or other people of colour, the current inequitable vaccine rollout is a textbook example of structural racial discrimination. 

The International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination requires that countries take effective measures “to review governmental, national and local policies, and to amend, rescind or nullify any laws or regulations which have the effect of creating or perpetuating racial discrimination wherever it exists.” Countries have an obligation under the convention to “prevent, prohibit and eradicate” all practices of racial discrimination particularly “racial segregation and apartheid.”

Yet the US, UK, Germany, Norway, and Switzerland have opposed or willfully failed to take all available measures to increase global supply of and equitable access to vaccines and other COVID-19 medical technologies, a violation of their obligations under the human rights convention.

Globally, 73% of all COVID-19 vaccine doses have gone to just 10 countries. Rich countries have administered 61 times more doses per capita than poorer countries and delivered only 14% of the 1.8 billion doses promised to poor countries. Just 5.8% of Africans have been vaccinated. The top 10 high-income countries will have hoarded 870 million excess doses of vaccines by the end of 2021. Countries in the Global South stand to lose $2.3 trillion from now until 2025 if they can’t vaccinate 60% of their population by mid-2022. 

The appeal asks the CERD Committee to compel the US, UK, Germany, Norway, and Switzerland to “respect, protect and fulfil their human rights obligations,” as well as to take several immediate actions, including:

Demand that the Respondent States immediately support, implement, and enforce a temporary waiver of the intellectual property barriers on COVID-19 vaccines, tests, and treatments currently imposed by the World Trade Organisation’s Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS), as requested by India and South Africa in October 2020, and 
Mandate technology and knowledge transfers from the relevant pharmaceutical corporations to the many manufacturers around the world standing by to ramp up production of these life-saving medical technologies.

The CERD meets from November 15 in a weeks-long session coinciding with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial meeting on November 30. The WTO ministerial is a key opportunity to resolve the year-long impasse on the proposal to break the corporate monopoly control of COVID-19 healthcare technologies by granting the TRIPS waiver. 

Tian Johnson, Founder & Lead Strategist, African Alliance and member of the People’s Vaccine Alliance, said: “As a consequence of neocolonial economic and social policies in Africa, fragile health systems impact communities’ access to health services in much of the continent. Africa will become known as the continent of COVID-19 – not because of vaccine hesitancy but because of the inequity, greed, and inaction of pharmaceutical companies and political leaders of the North. Having to rely only on the continent’s own capacity and resources will not be enough to save African lives. Nor should it be. African lives matter, just as much as lives in Berlin, Washington, Tel Aviv, Geneva, London, Toronto or Brussels. COVID-19 is a global crisis that requires global action, whose response all countries should be able to share equally.”

Paula Litvachky, from the Center for Legal and Social Studies in Argentina, said: “Latin America has been extremely affected by the pandemic. It concentrates almost 25 per cent of all COVID-19 deaths in a continent that is less than 10 per cent of the world’s population. Although there is regional industrial capacity, many States have had problems accessing vaccines. Groups such as indigenous peoples, Afro-descendants and racialized sectors are harder hit than others, both by the virus and by the dramatic social and economic crises it is provoking.”

Anele Yawa, General Secretary of the Treatment Action Campaign and a member of the People’s Vaccine Alliance, said: “Big Pharma has prioritized excessive profits over protecting people’s health for too long. Often they are aided and abetted by governments in the Global North through their inaction or opposition to a more just system. We have repeatedly seen this occur in many fights for access to affordable medicines, from the fight for HIV medicines in the early 2000s and more recently in our fight to Fix the Patent Laws to ensure more affordable medicines for cancer, TB, mental health and beyond. Yet again now with COVID-19, we are seeing Big Pharma greed being prioritized over people’s lives all over the world. Governments must fulfil their international obligations and help prioritize people over profits by ensuring vaccine equity for all, irrespective of where you were born, poverty, gender or immigration status.”

Joshua Castellino, Executive Director of Minority Rights Group International, said: ""COVID-19 has hit people of colour, women, indigenous people, and other minority and discriminated groups harder in terms of infections, deaths, lack of access to healthcare, resultant poverty, and even violence and emotional trauma. The discrimination of the virus is being revisited by vaccine discrimination, as rich nations deliberately withhold and deny these same groups of people equitable access to it.”  

Meena Jagannath, coordinator of the Global Network of Movement Lawyers at Movement Law Lab, said: “We have tabled an evidenced-based challenge to the UN, an institution meant to embody the spirit of multilateral cooperation. Our evidence points to specific actions by the named states in perpetuating structural divisions between the global north and the global south that are rooted in historical colonialism, all in the service of profit and the corporate capture of power. This contravenes their legal obligations under international covenants and agreements they’ve ratified. This is a test-of-our-times for the UN system to engage and correct. We are deadly serious in our resolve to seek justice and redress.” 

Mandivavarira Mudarikwa, Attorney, Women's Legal Centre, South Africa, a member of ESCR-Net - International Network for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, said: “It is undeniable that women in their diversity, especially those of colour, have disproportionately been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including in shouldering the greatest burden of healthcare and unpaid care work. The inequitable availability of access to health care, personal protective equipment and the distribution of vaccines, and other lifesaving treatments has laid bare the ongoing discrimination that women face in their daily lives. Critical, transformative action is needed immediately if we are to substantively effect change and bring about just and equal access to the right to health. We therefore support the submission of the CERD urgent action appeal aimed at addressing the gender and racial injustice that persists and hope that others will join in this collective action.”

The petition urges CERD to find that these countries must prioritise actions that will protect people’s lives instead of the corporate-controlled intellectual property of the vaccine. They should be supporting -- rather than blocking -- a proposal at the WTO to waive these intellectual property monopolies, so that more countries are able to make more and cheaper vaccines and other COVID healthcare technologies. 

Germany, the UK, Norway and Switzerland have actively opposed moves to waive intellectual property barriers on all COVID-19 vaccine technologies at the WTO. The US has declared support but only for a narrow waiver on the vaccine alone, while failing to use other mechanisms at its disposal e.g. mandating technology transfers through use of the Defense Production Act. 

The petition is also strengthened by a separate legal brief signed by jurists around the world which finds that these “blocking” states are also, by their actions, breaching a number of covenant and treaty obligations under international human rights law. The brief says these countries are violating both the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, along with a number of treaties they have signed as members of the WTO, including their legal obligations of international cooperation. A broad legal coalition is also advancing additional complaints in other forums, including a submission to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) to surface the gender discrimination.  

The petitioning groups include African Alliance, Center for Economic and Social Rights, Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales, Minority Rights Group, Oxfam International and Treatment Action Campaign. The petition was coordinated by Global Network of Movement Lawyers (of Movement Law Lab) and ESCR-Net, and is supported by SECTION27 and other organizations within the People's Vaccine Alliance.

2022/0096,Article,https://www.sundayguardianlive.com/legally-speaking/indias-global-profile-taken-wings,"Notwithstanding, recent reports by western NGOs questioning democratic credentials and the debate in the UK Parliament on farmer’s protest, global events show that there is nothing to hold back India from becoming a global power. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s participation in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue also known as the Quad — strategic forum between Australia, India, Japan and the US, besides its supplying vaccines to a large number of countries, shows that India has significantly enlarged its global profile.
India’s gifting of vaccines has polished its global image and earned it goodwill, especially in South Asia where it is often criticized for its “big brother” behaviour. It has also served as a powerful soft power tool to counter China’s considerable influence in South Asia, Africa and elsewhere.
India maintaining a supply line of vaccines has come to a great relief for the world as all big powers engaged in ‘vaccine nationalism’, hoarding vaccines and not sharing them with poorer countries. According to Duke University’s Global Health Institute, a group of advanced countries, accounting for only 16 per cent of the world’s population, have secured 60 per cent of the global vaccine supplies for themselves. Canada heads the list of ‘vaccine nationalists’, having secured vaccine supplies nearly ten times its population, while the US has stocked enough doses to vaccinate every citizen well over six times. Other countries securing vaccine supplies well beyond their domestic requirements are Australia, Chile, the UK, and members of the European Union.
The Quad also decided to launch a mega vaccine initiative under which coronavirus vaccines will be produced in India for the Indo-Pacific region – to counter Chinese influence. It recognized that India is sharing its available vaccine supplies with several countries, while also ensuring that domestic demand is met.
Briefing reporters on the summit, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said it was decided that India’s manufacturing capacity is something that is going to be leveraged to make COVID-19 vaccines. The aim is to produce a billion doses by the end of 2022. He said the financing for the creation of additional capacities will come from the US and Japan while Australia will contribute to the last mile logistics and delivery help. Australia will also finance countries that are going to receive the vaccines.

India’s commitments
According to the President of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Borge Brende, the world has already realized India’s vision of becoming a $5-trillion economy in the next five years and a $10-trillion economy in the next decade-and-a-half. India’s commitment to renewable energy through voluntary and ambitious renewable power capacity targets, a lead role in the Paris Climate Agreement negotiations and the International Solar Alliance shows its aspiration of becoming a leader in environmental security and climate change mitigation.
India has also expanded its global stature in space exploration through widely celebrated breakthroughs such as its recent lunar mission and its distinction of becoming the fourth country worldwide to shoot down a low-orbit satellite with a missile.
Brende said India is also more involved in global humanitarian efforts and development initiatives, including infrastructure development in Afghanistan, the International North-South Transport Corridor, the Ashgabat Agreement, the Chabahar port and the India-Myanmar-Thailand highway.
Prime Minister Modi has often articulated his strong vision for an India-Africa cooperative interest and India’s deepened participation in coalitions demonstrate its growing global influence and appetite for enhanced visibility on a range of global initiatives and multilateral forums.
With half of its population of working age, India has a unique demographic advantage. Climbing to the 52nd spot in this year’s Global Innovation Index, India is one of the few countries to have consecutively improved its rank for nine years.
“Its distinctive demographic advantage, technical prowess and knack for innovation, fused with the leap-frogging opportunities of Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies, can consolidate its position as a dominant force in global economic, political and strategic affairs,” said WEF president.
The world is paying attention to India as it shares its available vaccine supplies, instead of choosing the nationalist course of blocking exports. India has also offered 1.1 billion vaccine doses to the WHO’s COVAX program to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to poorer countries. As Modi has tweeted, “We are all together in the fight against this pandemic.
Simultaneously aware that the quest for becoming a great power must begin at home, India has undertaken groundbreaking structural reforms mirroring its growth ambitions and development priorities. Initiatives aimed at revamping India’s restrictive business regulations have already borne fruit. India’s 65-place leap in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business rankings demonstrates an improved business climate and expounded investor confidence.

Low key, non-lethal approach
India’s low key, non-lethal, soft-touch soothing diplomacy in Afghanistan has paid dividends. Schools, hospitals, technical training institutes, hospitality to the injured by flying them to Indian hospitals – all of this found their way to Afghan hearts. Visit parts of Hauz Rani opposite Max hospital in Saket, and you have Afghan eating houses complete with Chapli Kebabs, giant size naans, and travel agents offering amazing rates for the Delhi-Kabul-Delhi journey. Nothing can compare with the effectiveness of India’s diplomacy.
After having sent consignments of testing kits, personal protection equipment, respirators, and medicines to other countries to help them fight the COVID-19 pandemic, India is now reaching out to them with “vaccine diplomacy.”
India is a global pharmaceutical powerhouse, manufacturing some 20% of all generic medicines and accounting for as much as 62% of global vaccine production, so it was quick off the mark when the pandemic struck. Before COVID-19 vaccines were developed, India supplied some 100 countries with hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol and sent pharmaceuticals, test kits, and other equipment to around 90 countries. Later, even before the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was approved, Adar Poonawalla, the 40-year-old head of the privately-owned Serum Institute of India, audaciously decided to manufacture it – a billion-dollar gamble. When approvals came, SII was able to churn out millions of doses, making them available to the government both for domestic use and export.
In keeping with its “Neighborhood First” initiative, the first consignments of the Covishield vaccine — which is developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India — and Covaxin, a locally developed and manufactured vaccine by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research, have gone to its immediate neighbours, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Myanmar, and Nepal, and key Indian Ocean partners, Mauritius and Seychelles. Sri Lanka will begin receiving vaccine consignments from January 27 and Afghanistan will do so after it has completed regulatory clearance procedures.
Vaccine Maitri (Vaccine Friendship), as India calls its drive to provide other countries with the COVID-19 vaccine, has evoked a positive response globally. Neighbouring governments, including ones like Nepal which have been sparring with India in recent months, have expressed gratitude, while others like the U.S. applauded India’s gesture.
India’s gesture of sharing its vaccine supplies with other countries stands in sharp contrast to several rich countries that are cornering, even hoarding vaccine supplies. Although a handful of rich countries account for just 16 per cent of the world’s population, they have cornered 60 per cent of the vaccines bought globally.

Vaccine Maitri
India’s Vaccine Maitri initiative will help ease to some extent the” vaccine inequality” in the world by making COVID-19 vaccines more accessible to developing countries.
India is one of the largest manufacturers of vaccines in the world; it supplies around 60 per cent of the global requirement of DPT, BCG, and measles vaccines. Vaccine Maitri will add to its credibility as a reliable vaccine producer. Indian vaccines have shown fewer side-effects and are low cost and easier to store and transport. Global demand for its COVID-19 vaccines is soaring; some 90 countries have entered into pacts for its procurement. Its commercial supply of the vaccines will benefit Indian pharmaceutical businesses now and in the long run.
Both India and China supplied Asian and African countries with protective equipment and medicines during the pandemic. Their vaccine diplomacy is a follow-up effort to win hearts, minds and influence, especially in the developing world.
India has gained a head-start over China in this regard, especially in South Asia. Chinese vaccines are yet to reach the region. Even Pakistan, its closest ally, is expected to receive the first consignment of Chinese COVID-19 vaccines only by the end of this month.
China’s conditions for the supply of its COVID-19 vaccines also seems to have not gone down too well with some South Asian countries, including Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. China wanted the Bangladesh government to share the cost of vaccine trials and when it refused, talks on vaccine supply broke down. It prompted Bangladesh to turn to India.
Indian vaccines are arriving even in richer countries. The UK has ordered ten million doses from the Serum Institute of India. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau telephoned Modi to ask for two million vaccines; the first half-million were delivered within days. Trudeau effusively declared that the world’s victory over COVID-19 would be “because of India’s tremendous pharmaceutical capacity, and Prime Minister Modi’s leadership in sharing this capacity with the world.”
India is using the country’s capacity in this sector subtly to advertise an alternative to China’s economic and geopolitical dominance. While China has been secretive in releasing data about its vaccines, leading to controversies over the efficacy of them, India organized trips for foreign ambassadors to visit pharmaceutical factories in Pune and Hyderabad.

Helping hand to counter HIV/AIDS
Indian companies made critical interventions during the HIV/AIDS pandemic by supplying affordable antiretroviral medicines to African countries, where major pharmaceutical producers were demanding excessively high prices. After the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria took shape as a multi-stakeholder initiative to reduce the burden of these diseases, India’s generic pharmaceutical industry emerged as one of the largest suppliers.
In June Serum Institute of India (SII), entered into a licensing agreement with British-Swedish biopharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca, to supply one billion doses of the Oxford University COVID-19 vaccine to middle- and low-income countries. Before this, another Indian biopharmaceutical company, Bharat Biotech International Limited, together with the Indian Council of Medical Research, began collaboratively developing a COVID-19 vaccine, ‘Covaxin’.
India is also supplying 10 million vaccine doses to Africa and one million to UN health workers under the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility coordinated by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI).
Several other countries, including Mongolia, Oman, the Philippines, Bahrain, and the Dominican Republic could also be included in India’s ‘vaccine assistance’ program. India is using its soft power to assist developing countries, a role that it has increasingly been playing as a development partner.
The government has allowed for commercial vaccine exports to countries seeking them while placing an embargo on the commercial sale of vaccines in India. Brazil and South Africa are benefiting from this, importing millions of doses of Covishield.

World wants India
According to Biswajit Dhar is Professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning School of Social Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, India’s initiatives to make vaccines widely available to developing countries, together with growing evidence of the benefits from making COVID-19 vaccines accessible, suggests that during a pandemic, medical products must be treated as global public goods.
The world wants to keep India onside as they recognize its rising strategic importance in Asia as a counterweight to Beijing. India is an important economic and strategic partner, or potential partner, for countries ranging from France to the US to the Gulf states. India’s status as a rising free-market, rancorous democracy known for soft power exports like yoga and Bollywood lend it a benign character, whereas China often acquires the ire of the international community owing to the common narrative surrounding its efforts to build an Orwellian authoritarian system.

2022/0097,News,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-08/12/c_1310123685.htm,"DHAKA, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- China's contributions through the COVAX Facility have reflected Beijing's commitment to global anti-COVID-19 fight, Bangladesh health experts said.

They expressed appreciation of China's contributions after Bangladesh Tuesday night received 1.7 million Chinese COVID-19 vaccine doses shipped via the COVAX Facility.

This is the first among three consignments that are scheduled to arrive in Bangladesh from China this week.

With their remarks, the Bangladeshi experts joined the distinguished persons around the world who had expressed admiration to the Chinese leadership's efforts in promoting international cooperation in the fight against COVID-19 and making vaccines a global public good.

China has recently pledged to provide 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to the world throughout this year and offer 100 million U.S. dollars to COVAX.

Muzaherul Huq, former Southeast Asia Region adviser at the World Health Organization (WHO), said Wednesday this is a great initiative and will be much appreciated by the people of poverty-stricken countries who can not afford to purchase the vaccine for their people.

""The COVAX participation of China with its 2 vaccines will be a great contribution,"" said the expert.

Also, he said China has already supplied vaccines to people of many countries and regions around the world.

While some rich countries are playing vaccine diplomacy in a period when the world is in a crisis, ""China is proving that they want to help poorer countries in this crisis to save human lives,"" said the expert.

M Mushtuq Husain, adviser to the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) under Bangladesh's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, said Chinese vaccine contributions would surely boost Bangladeshi efforts in the country's nationwide ongoing mass inoculation drive.

""Every vaccine is very important for us. We're very happy that China sent many vaccine doses for Bangladesh through COVAX Facility,"" he said.

Free shipments of AstraZeneca’s vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, the world’s biggest producer of vaccines, have begun arriving in the Maldives, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal.

Myanmar and the Seychelles are next in line to get free consignments as India uses its strength as one of the world’s biggest makers of generic drugs to build friendships.

“The government of India has shown goodwill by providing the vaccine in grant. This is at the people’s level, it is the public who are suffering the most from Covid-19,” said Nepal’s Minister for Health and Population Hridayesh Tripathi.

The gesture comes at a time that India’s ties with Nepal have been strained by a territorial dispute and Indian concern over China’s expanding political and economic influence in the Himalayan nation sandwiched between the Asian giants.

China, which had promised Nepal help to deal with the pandemic, is awaiting Nepali clearance for its Sinopharm shots.

“We’ve asked them to submit more documents and information before we give them the approval,” said Santosh K.C., spokesman for Nepal’s department of drug administration.

Bangladesh was supposed to get 110,000 doses of vaccine free from Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech, but Bangladesh refused to contribute towards the development cost of the vaccine leading to deadlock.

Bangladesh has instead turned to India for urgent supplies and on Thursday was due to receive 2 million shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine as a gift from India.

“India is making the AstraZeneca vaccine which makes all the difference. It can be stored and transported at normal refrigerated temperatures and countries like Bangladesh have that facility,” a Bangladesh health official said.

India for years has struggled to match the pace of Chinese investment in countries such as Sri Lanka, Nepal and the Maldives, where China is building ports, roads and power stations as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.

But the demand for vaccines in these countries desperate to revive their tourism-dependent economies has offered Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government a way to claw back ground, diplomats say.

India is considering giving away anything from 12 million to 20 million shots to its neighbours in the first wave of assistance over the next three to four weeks, one government source said.

India is also helping with the training of health workers in some of these countries and the setting up of the infrastructure to administer the shots, the source said.

“It’s a well-crafted, calibrated series of actions you are seeing, they confirm the validity of our ‘neighbourhood first’ policy,” said a former Indian ambassador, Rajiv Bhatia.

“It plays to our strengths in science and pharma, and this is our moment to shine.”

""Thanks to the US commitment to playing a leading role in ending the pandemic everywhere, 2.5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine will begin to ship to Bangladesh,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Illustrating the urgency, delivery is expected to be completed this week.

Bangladesh, which neighbors India, began a severe lockdown on Monday in response to spiraling infections from the Delta variant. People are restricted to their homes, with offices closed, traffic shut down and the security forces enforcing compliance.

The South Asian country of around 170 million people recorded nearly 6,000 cases last Friday. Authorities say that districts near the Indian border are suffering especially badly, with hospitals in the cities of Khulna and Rajshahi overwhelmed.

Bangladesh ""has a 55 percent week-over-week increase in cases, driven largely by the Delta variant,"" a White House official said, explaining how the country made it onto the urgent list.

President Joe Biden has declared the United States the world's vaccine ""arsenal"" in the war on Covid-19.

The role reflects US pharmaceutical power but also Biden's emphasis on restoring Washington's leadership around the world after the tempestuous and often chaotic years under Donald Trump.

US officials deny they are competing in ""vaccine diplomacy"" with authoritarian China and Russia, which have used nationally produced vaccines to fill the supply vacuum in less-developed regions during the pandemic.

- No 'strings attached' -

Like many other countries, Bangladesh has desperately sought more vaccines and has not been picky about where they come from.

Health minister Zahid Maleque said in May that the country wants to buy 50 million doses from China's Sinopharm.

It also wants to buy five million Sputnik doses, foreign minister A.K. Abdul Momen said after meeting the Russian ambassador this month.

The White House pointedly said that its vaccine shipments -- mostly made through the World Health Organization's Covax program -- come free in all senses.

""We are sharing these doses not to secure favors or extract concessions. Our vaccines do not come with strings attached. We are doing this with the singular objective of saving lives,"" the official said.

The Biden administration has committed to donating $2 billion to Covax and also purchasing 500 million Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines for the African Union and 92 poorer countries. At the recent G7 summit in Britain, US partners agreed to donate another 500 million doses.

""Putting an end to this pandemic requires eliminating it around the world,"" the White House official said. ""This is a unique moment in history and it requires American leadership.""

Additionally, some 80 million doses from the US supply are earmarked for foreign allocation by the end of June.Two million doses of the Pfizer vaccine are now being shipped to Peru and 1.5 million Moderna doses to Pakistan, the White House said earlier Monday.",https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-11/rloo9hso_moderna650_625x300_16_November_20.jpg,"June 29, 2021",NDTV,US Sending Bangladesh 2.5 Million Doses Of Moderna's Covid Vaccine: White House,

How very true this observation by the Nigerian World Health Organisation (WHO) Special Envoy for the Access to the Covid-19 Tools Accelerator is! Despite the fastest-ever vaccine development in history and a global vaccination campaign, we have by no means got on top of the global public health crisis. There has been no real solidarity-based response to the pandemic, in terms of sharing out either the vaccine or the economic burden. The socio-economic consequences of the lockdowns and measures to fight the pandemic have hit the poorest sections of society everywhere in the world, particularly in the Global South. It has had the effect of widening the gap between rich and poor all over the world.

There are two very different realities of the pandemic between low- and high-income countries: industrial countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, the USA and Israel are already giving their populations their third and fourth doses. The vaccination rate is also very high in many emerging nations, particularly in Latin America.

In the other reality, we are seeing that in many countries, citizens have not yet had even their first dose of vaccine. As of January 2022, just 5% of the population of the low-income countries had been fully vaccinated and just 11% had received at least one dose of vaccine. In Yemen, where civil war has been raging for years, less than 2% of the population are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, while in Haiti, plagued by natural disasters and sociopolitical maladministration, the figure is not even 1%.

Vaccination programmes are making very slow headway on the African continent, with the exception of countries like South Africa: 10% of the 1.3 billion people who live in Africa have been fully vaccinated. The vaccination rate in Senegal, for instance, is 6%, while it is barely 4% in Burkina Faso and just 0.2% in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Every day around the world, six times more people are given a booster than people in low-income countries receive their first dose.  

The enormous divide in vaccination distribution between the African countries and the EU has seriously damaged the standing and credibility of the EU. In mid-December last year, Ghana’s President, Nana Akufo-Addo, warned EU legislators that vaccine nationalism and hoarding vaccines to give booster shots could hamper vaccination efforts in Africa.

The Secretary General of the UN, António Guterres, has also repeatedly addressed the global imbalance in the distribution of vaccines since the pandemic broke out two years ago. He rightly describes the fact that vaccination rates in high-income countries are seven times higher than in African countries as “shameful”.

This is negligent and irresponsible, as we are still a long way from achieving global herd immunity: only around 50% of people around the world have been fully vaccinated.

Global inequality grows during the pandemic
The longer the global vaccination campaign takes, the longer the pandemic will last and the more serious the global socio-economic consequences will be.

The latest reports by organisations such as Oxfam and the World Bank revealed the potential scale of the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic and the measures to tackle it. People living in poverty or in danger of poverty have been particularly hard hit. Around the world, more than 160 million people have been driven into poverty by the pandemic. This number will only rise: by 2030, there could be a further 207 million people living in extreme poverty, according to the UNDP. People with low education, limited assets, people working under precarious employment conditions and the entire groups of the population who lack access to essential resources are particularly feeling the fallout. Economic recovery from the pandemic could take more than a decade for all these people.

Women have been more adversely affected than men by the economic impact of the pandemic. According to the International Labour Organisation, the employment rates of men returned to 2019 levels in 2021, while there are 13 million fewer women in work than two years ago. The shocking socio-economic inequality and the breaking of the global pledge of justice, which can be observed in practically all spheres of life, are unfortunately central characteristics of this global public health crisis.

Ever since the pandemic began to take hold, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has stressed the absolute importance of acting and vaccinating globally, if global economic recovery is not to be hampered. Should Covid-19 have longer-term effects, worldwide GDP losses could grow to 5.3 billion USD within five years and cost several million human lives. According to the IMF experts, this means that by the middle of this year, 70% of the world population will need to have been vaccinated.

All necessary steps must therefore be discussed and the existing barriers taken down if efforts to bring the pandemic under control – which must, by definition, take place at a global level – can ultimately succeed.

Tackling the uneven distribution of vaccines
The vaccines needed to do it are available. Access to them, however, is difficult and uneven for several reasons – high prices, lack of infrastructure and awareness as well as vaccination scepticism.

The high and excessive prices for vaccines have been an enormous barrier from the outset and are preventing a fair global distribution of vaccines.

In August, the Financial Times reported that a dose of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from the EU costs 19.50 euros and that Moderna is charging 25.50 USD (21.60 euros) for a dose. However, British researchers from Imperial College London presented a study calculating that in mass production conditions, a dose of mRNA vaccine can be made for just 1.18 to 2.85 USD. The petition “No Profit on Pandemic” – a European citizens’ initiative – is therefore calling for contracts with vaccine manufacturers to be made public. There should be more efforts at political level to bring prices down: the vaccines were ultimately developed with billions of dollars of public money, yet there has been no political involvement in price-setting.

COVAX is not enough
To support the roll-out of vaccines to all countries, not just the wealthy ones, the platform Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) was set up in April 2020. Its aim is to support the development and production of Covid-19 vaccines and to negotiate their prices. The head of the vaccine alliance, Gavi Seth Berkley, has announced that COVAX has already supplied a billion doses of vaccine, in a shipment to Rwanda in mid-January. This, he stresses, marks a milestone in the biggest and fastest global vaccine distribution campaign in history, benefiting 144 countries (article in German only).

But this is too little, too late, according to the President of the German trade union Erziehung und Wissenschaft, Maike Finnern, in her letter of 6 January 2022 to four German federal ministers (article in German only). Out of 1.8 billion doses of vaccine pledged by the EU, Norway, Switzerland and the G7 states, just 261 million doses have so far been delivered.

And even worse: far too often, donated vaccine comes with a very short expiry date. Nigeria, for instance, was forced to destroy more than 1 million expired doses of AstraZeneca vaccine at the end of December 2021. Not only is this cynical, it feeds into vaccine scepticism and undermines the credibility of the industrial countries even further.

Bolstering production capacity in the Global South
The speedy delivery of vaccines is a useful interim measure, but is neither reliable nor sustainable. Instead, the countries of the Global South should be supported in setting up their own production capacities for vaccines, tests and drugs to combat the virus. Critically, this would give them the resources to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the event of future pandemics.

It all comes down to local vaccine production. In October 2021, Rwanda and Senegal signed an agreement with BioNTech to set up facilities to produce mRNA vaccines under licence. Moderna has also announced plans to build a production facility for mRNA medicines and vaccines on the African continent. Precisely where and when the project will get underway, however, is not yet known.

Temporary patent release
Well over a year ago, the WTO received a proposal by India and South Africa to waive patent protection for vaccines, at least temporarily, under acute pandemic conditions, so as to expand production capacities. More than 100 WTO member countries have so far lent their support to the proposal. In May 2021, the USA announced its agreement, but reportedly told a virtual WTO meeting in December that it would only support an exemption covering vaccines. This will keep the equally essential treatment drugs, diagnostic equipment and medical devices out of the scope of the regulation.

Contrary to the demands of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the new German Federal  Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Svenja Schulze, are still completely opposed to any temporary patent waiver (article in German only). Their preferred option is to concentrate on business partnerships to produce mRNA vaccines under licence. The German Federal Minister for the Economy and Climate Action, Robert Habeck, has also taken the Greens’ position 180°, telling a press conference (video in German only) at the end of January 2022 that a temporary lifting of patent provisions would be a pointless move. He makes the case instead for deals to be struck with manufacturers to supply poorer countries with vaccine at cost price.

The calls made by the new German Federal government and its predecessor for vaccine supplies, licence issuance and company partnerships between the industrialised and developing countries are well known. As far as the countries of the Global South are concerned, this exacerbates their dependence on Western pharmaceuticals groups, their controls and their prices.

Critics of the patent waiver approach point out that the production of new vaccines is far too expensive and at least in the short term, unrealistic in the developing and emerging countries. This argument simply does not hold water. The South African biotech company, Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines, is currently working on the development of Africa’s own first coronavirus vaccine, which imitates mRNA technology and will not be patented (article in German only). And according to reports by Human Rights Watch (HRW), there are more than 120 Pharma companies in Asia, Africa and Latin America that are capable of producing an mRNA vaccine if provided with the corresponding technology by their counterparts in Germany and the USA.

At the beginning of March 2022, the WTO Ministerial Conference will return again to the issue of the TRIPS waiver. It is high time that the EU and the UK stop blocking the way for negotiations and acting against the majority of WTO countries, against expert opinion and against growing voices from civil society and economic circles: international pressure has been piled on by healthcare unions and Nobel prizewinners, plus more than 20 Olympic and Paralympic athletes and 65 major investors, managing assets in excess of 3.5 billion USD. In a letter to a group of non-executive Presidents of EU countries in early January of this year, the Irish President, Michael D. Higgins, also urged support for the TRIPS agreement waiver.

Last year, encouragingly, the pharmaceutical company Merck announced a voluntary licensing agreement with the UN-backed Medicines Patent Pool (MPP). Under the agreement, Merck gave the MPP permission to grant sub-licences for the production of the new oral Covid-19 medicine Molnupiravir to manufacturers in other countries. It has since been reported that the MPP has signed agreements with more than two dozen generics manufacturers in 11 countries, including Bangladesh, Vietnam and South Africa, for the production of versions of Merck’s Covid-19 tablet medication to supply 105 developing countries. This will allow the drug to be produced and sold cheaply in the poorest countries, in which coronavirus vaccines are hard to come by, thereby mitigating the most serious consequences for the populations.

In October, however, the organisation Médecins sans Frontières spoke out against the fact that the licensing structure will leave important countries such as Brazil out of its scope of application and contains several restrictive clauses. On the plus side, neither Merck nor Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and Emory University, which invented the drug, will receive licence fees on the generics manufacturers’ sales of Molnupiravir as long as Covid-19 continues to be a global public health emergency. To date, not a single Covid-19 vaccine manufacturer has agreed to a similar arrangement.

Public health infrastructure
Since it broke out, the pandemic has laid bare the weaknesses of the public health systems in every country of the world. A podcast by Medico International (available in German only) highlights how the increasing global commercialisation and commoditisation of health care has led to massive weaknesses in the system. The conclusions that are drawn from this are more important than ever.

The urban-rural gap in health care provision is startling. “We are not going to have shortages of vaccines any more, but our main concern and focus now is getting these vaccines to all corners of the country, including the remote mountain areas”, says Nepal’s Minister of Health.

To mitigate shortcomings in the infrastructure, the pandemic has prompted a number of creative approaches. In Ghana and Rwanda, for instance, drones are used to reach isolated communities. In Kenya, the young engineer Norah Magero has invented a solar-powered fridge, the Vaccibox, which can be used in conjunction with a bicycle, motorbike or small boat to transport vaccines to rural areas with no electricity supply. 70% of the population of Kenya live rurally.

African states have many other logistical challenges to overcome. According to the WHO, Africa is 1.3 billion USD short for operating costs, including the costs of refrigerated logistical chains and data recording software. There is also a lack of vaccination syringes and freezers, training and wages for vaccination and support staff.

The current pandemic has once again highlighted the lamentable state of the healthcare infrastructure in African countries. The Global Health Security Index (GHSI) of 2019 put the countries of sub-Saharan Africa into the category of countries least prepared for a pandemic.

If a lack of staff in the healthcare sector is a major problem even in the wealthier countries, by way of comparison and in proportion to the population, the poorer countries have an almost 10 times greater shortfall of nursing staff. This is compounded by the fact that several industrial countries, including Germany, recruit healthcare staff from the Global South, including Mexico, India, sub-Saharan Africa and parts of the Caribbean, making their shortages even greater.

Besides the lack of healthcare staff, the industrialised and developing countries share another common problem, that is hampering the vaccination campaigns: vaccine scepticism. “There’s no doubt that the delay in the provision of vaccines is a factor”, adds Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the Regional Director for Africa of the World Health Organisation. Just as is the case in Germany, healthcare staff in India not infrequently come across fierce resistance from individuals who believe that vaccines can cause serious adverse effects, even death.

As well as infrastructure and staff, therefore, more awareness and information are needed. “In low-income countries, little or nothing has been invested in information and advertising for vaccines. Why do we expect to just drop vaccines off at airports and arrange a photo shoot, then people will flock to the airport and pick up a vaccine?” Dr Omer, epidemiologist at Yale University, asks wryly.

International cooperation: staking credibility
Instead of putting all efforts into a solidarity-based response, the international community has unfortunately once again demonstrated its own imbalance in this public health crisis. Most states have focused predominantly on themselves.

What we are also seeing, again and again, is a competition as to who can supply vaccines the quickest. It has also been a race for political spheres of influence between Europe, the US, China and Russia. China and Russia have supplied the countries of the Global South with their vaccines in great style, Russia principally in Latin America (including Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Guatemala) and parts of Africa (Algeria, Namibia). China has focused on its neighbours, such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, most countries of Latin America and, so far, fifty countries in Africa (article in German only). The Chinese government delivered its second vaccination donation to Nicaraguan at the end of December 2021, after the central-American country resumed relations with the Asian giant and broke them off with Taiwan.

For the Big Pharma companies of the industrialised world, it is mainly about securing their markets and the fat profits they will make by setting prices and not waiving their patents.

This means that vaccines will continue to be used in countries’ own geopolitical and geo-economic interests to establish long-term political dependence in countries that produce no vaccines themselves and cannot afford to pay market prices for them.

A lot more credibility was lost when South Africa gave an early warning of the discovery of the Omicron variant. African heads of state or government have reacted furiously to the travel bans put in place against several African countries due to the new variant. Wealthy countries were criticised on social media for their hypocrisy in slapping new restrictions on Africa rather than supplying them with vaccines.

This reality is at odds with the EU’s stated intention of breathing new life into cooperation with Africa at the joint summit with the African Union in February.

Rebuilding trust, creating for solutions for all
Regaining credibility and rebuilding trust would be a possibility in the near future if patents on vaccines and drugs were temporarily lifted.

In a study in “The Lancet”, the authors reached the conclusion that access to vaccines can also be a valuable tool to fight vaccination scepticism. They point out that the introduction of Ebola viruses in West Africa showed that the physical presence of vaccines strengthened the commitment of the national political leadership, extending as far as the local communities.

It is very positive that the EU and the German Federal government are actively donating vaccines, including to COVAX. Germany is now the world’s second-largest vaccine donor. However, the logistical framework conditions in the countries of the Global South and potentially long delivery times within these countries need to be taken into account.

These measures must be expanded to include testing kits and drugs and be accompanied by support to create sustainable healthcare infrastructures in the Global South.

In the medium-and long terms, we need to address structural questions of global healthcare and global (in)justice, so that the whole world, rather than just small parts of it, is better prepared for future challenges. According to the UN Secretary General, this is within reach, as long as investments are made in monitoring, early identification and rapid reaction in every country, as well as bolstering the capacity for action of the WHO.

This may sound like a Herculean task, but in the opinion of WHO Special Envoy, Dr. Ayoade Alakija, it is entirely possible, “but only if a life in Mumbai matters as much as a life in Brussels, if a life in São Paulo matters as much as a life in Geneva, and if a life in Harare matters as much as a life in Washington DC”.

2022/0102,Article,https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/10/13/china-s-influence-in-south-asia-vulnerabilities-and-resilience-in-four-countries-pub-85552,"China’s economic and political footprint has expanded so quickly that many countries, even those with relatively strong state and civil society institutions, have struggled to grapple with the implications. There has been growing attention to this issue in the United States and the advanced industrial democracies of Japan and Western Europe. But “vulnerable” countries—those where the gap is greatest between the scope and intensity of Chinese activism, on the one hand, and, on the other, local capacity to manage and mitigate political and economic risks—face special challenges. In these countries, the tools and tactics of China’s activism and influence activities remain poorly understood among local experts and elites. Both within and beyond these countries, meanwhile, policy too often transposes Western solutions and is not well adapted to local realities.

This is especially notable in two strategic regions: Southeastern, Central, and Eastern Europe; and South Asia. China’s economic and political profile has expanded unusually quickly in these two regions, but many countries lack a deep bench of local experts who can match analysis of the domestic implications of Chinese activism to policy recommendations that reflect domestic political and economic ground truth.

To address this gap, the Carnegie Endowment initiated a global project to better understand Chinese activities in eight “pivot” countries in these two strategic regions.

The project’s first objective was to enhance local awareness of the scope and nature of Chinese activism in states with (1) weak state institutions, (2) fragile civil societies, or (3) countries where “elite capture” is a feature of the political landscape.

Second, the project aimed to strengthen capacity by facilitating a sharing of experiences and best practices across national boundaries.

Third, the project sought to develop policy prescriptions for the governments of these countries, as well as the United States and its strategic partners, to mitigate and respond to activities inimical to political independence or well-balanced economic growth and development.

To establish a comprehensive picture of China’s activities and their impact, this project dug deeply into Chinese activism in four case countries in each region—eight countries in total.

We began by holding workshops, so that influencers across countries could share experiences and compare notes. Invited participants included policymakers, experts, journalists, and others—all with deep local knowledge, steeped in their countries’ politics, economies, and civil societies. In Europe, the four countries were Georgia, Greece, Hungary, and Romania, and in South Asia, Bangladesh, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Cross-national discussions among these regional participants aimed to raise awareness, discuss the implications of China’s growing activism in their countries, and compare notes on the diverse ways in which these various countries had managed the rapid influx of Chinese capital, programs, people, technology, and other sources of influence.

After holding several workshops for each region, Carnegie scholars conducted extensive interviews and a comprehensive review of open-source data and literature on Chinese activities—including extensive media monitoring in local languages, from Bengali to Nepali, Georgian to Greek. These deep dives aimed to measure Chinese influence along three dimensions:

(1) Chinese activities that shape or constrain the choices and options for local political and economic elites;

(2) Chinese activities that influence or constrain the parameters of local media and public opinion; and

(3) China’s impact on local civil society and academia.

The first of these three dimensions is important because China’s sheer size means that it will inevitably play a role in these two strategic geographies. China is the world’s largest trader and manufacturer—and it sits on a significant pool of foreign exchange reserves and capital that countries in all three regions will invariably wish to tap. For this reason, these surveys aimed to identify, distinguish, and analyze only those specific activities that could constrict options, reduce the scope of choice, and reward a narrow interest group or elite.

The second of the three dimensions is crucial because China frequently couples its use of economic and political carrots and levers to broad-ranging public relations outreach. When China floods a country not just with investment but also with strategic messages designed to influence public opinion, there is often little space left for counter-narratives, especially in countries that lack independent media or have weak civil societies.

The third of the three dimensions is critical because in the most vulnerable countries of these two regions, civil society and academia are often too fragile to provide balanced coverage of the activism of external powers. In some cases, Chinese funding and so-called united front tactics have shaped domestic narratives.

Beijing, like other outside powers, cultivates friendly voices in nearly every country. But in some countries, there are few counterweights.

By exploring all three dimensions of Chinese influence simultaneously, Carnegie’s initiative has aimed to generate a clearer and well-balanced picture of Chinese activism and messaging in Europe and South Asia, while fostering a cross-national network of influencers who will continue to compare notes, learn across national boundaries, and spur a genuinely regional conversation about China’s rise and its far-reaching implications.",,"October 13, 2021",Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,China’s Influence in South Asia: Vulnerabilities and Resilience in Four Countries,
2022/0103,News,https://www.wsj.com/articles/india-starts-covid-19-vaccine-drive-to-neighboring-countries-11611234933,"NEW DELHI—India has started donating millions of doses of vaccine to its South Asian neighbors, using its position as a vaccine manufacturing hub to strengthen its ties in a region where China has been wielding increasing influence.

India announced this week that it is giving a million doses of vaccine to Nepal, 2 million to Bangladesh, 100,000 to the Maldives and 150,000 to Bhutan. It also plans to give 1.5 millions doses to Myanmar and 50,000 doses to Seychelles as early as Friday, said government officials, and begin commercial exports of the two vaccines which have received emergency approval and are already being mass produced in India.

As part of its attempts to counterbalance China’s rising profile in Asia and elsewhere, India is trying to tighten its ties to South Asia, Africa and Latin America by setting itself up as the go-to supplier for vaccines, said Sreeram Chaulia, dean at O.P. Jindal Global University’s School of International Affairs in Sonipat, India.“Through its Covid-19 vaccine diplomacy, India intends to leverage its strengths for soft power enhancement, especially in poorer nations,” he said. “There is a strategy to fortify the health-care systems of India’s immediate neighborhood first from Chinese encroachments, and then to span out to the rest of the world.”India has been on the defensive in much of South Asia as China has been issuing huge loans and using its infrastructure-building expertise to tighten ties in places traditionally within India’s sphere of influence, including Sri Lanka and Nepal as well as with its biggest rival in the region, Pakistan.Pakistan was notably absent from the list of places India is helping with what it promises will be the first wave of vaccine exports. Indian authorities say they have yet to receive any formal request from Islamabad but would consider any requests.

“We don’t know if Pakistan will ever ask India or prefer sourcing it through (a non-Indian) global alliance or a third country,” said an Indian government official.

Pakistan has approved the use of the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca PLC, but it is looking to the private sector or multinational organizations, not the government of India, for supplies. Islamabad has approached AstraZeneca for supply of its Covid-19 vaccine, not the government of India, Pakistani officials say.

“We would not like to ask, and they would not like to give,” said a Pakistani official.

Indian-made vaccines might still make their way to Pakistan. AstraZeneca has licensed the Serum Institute of India to manufacture its vaccine for distribution to lower-income countries. Any of the AstraZeneca vaccines that Pakistan manages to procure will be manufactured by SII, but brought in and distributed in Pakistan through their established agent in the country, Sind Medical Stores, a medical supplies distributor based in Karachi, Pakistani officials say.
Usman Ghani, a spokesman for Sind Medical Stores, said the Pakistani authorities had permitted his company to import the AstraZeneca vaccine from SII, but said he had no idea when or how many doses as they are waiting on the Indian company to make the vaccine available to them.

“It’s a tragedy that even on issues related to public health, which is a huge common interest, both countries cannot overcome their differences and cooperate with each other,” said Rifaat Hussain, a professor of public policy at Islamabad’s National University of Sciences and Technology. “There is zero cooperation in any matter between India and Pakistan.”

Islamabad has other options. It is in talks to acquire vaccines from two Chinese companies, and Pakistan is also in line to receive vaccines from an international initiative to make vaccines available to emerging markets, Pakistani officials say. Pakistan Thursday announced its first vaccine supply: 500,000 doses gifted by China.

Among the front-runners for the next wave of exports from India, South Africa is looking to secure a million doses of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine which is being made by Serum Institute of India later this month, and another 500,000 doses next month, according to a statement by the South African government.The Brazilian government too is looking to procure vaccines directly from Bharat Biotech, the Indian manufacturer of a locally developed vaccine. The Indian company hopes to supply it as much as 12 million doses over a period of time, said a spokesperson at Bharat Biotech.

Serum Institute said it plans to sell the AstraZeneca vaccine it produces for around 200 rupees, or $2.75 a dose. Bharat Biotech said it would export its vaccine for as little as $20 a dose.

A fire broke out Thursday at the facility of the Serum Institute—the world’s largest vaccine maker by volume—in the western Indian city of Pune, damaging floors of a building in the facility and causing a few casualties. The company’s chief executive Adar Poonawalla said in a tweet the incident won’t effect the production of the Covid-19 vaccines as a contingency plan was in place.

In addition to the free vaccines from India, Bangladesh is looking to pay for 30 million doses. Nepal wants to purchase 12 million doses and Bhutan 1 million more doses.

For exports to Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Mauritius, India is awaiting clearance from respective authorities in these countries.Correction

A circular by Dhaka District Primary Education Office said the first dose of pediatric Pfizer vaccines received from the COVAX facility will be given to children in 21 centers in the capital Dhaka starting from Aug. 25.

However, all the children aged 5-11 years across the country will come under the coverage, said the Ministry for Health and Family Welfare. Earlier, the age limit for COVID-19 vaccination was 12 to 17 years in Bangladesh.

Three million doses for children have arrived in the country through the COVAX facility, a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.

The Health Ministry has set a target of vaccinating some 22 million children aged 5-11 years across the country with the two-dose Pfizer vaccine. Vaccination will be administered in 55 zones in Dhaka for the next 14 days from Aug. 25.

The U.S. on Tuesday handed over additional 10 million Pfizer vaccine doses to Bangladesh to cover teens and adults. This delivery brings the total number of all U.S. vaccine donations to over 85 million doses.

The COVID-19 vaccination started on Feb. 7 last year in Bangladesh with more than 130 million people taking the first dose.

Over 120 million were given the second dose while over 40 million people were given a booster dose, according to the Directorate General of Health Services.

Low-income countries have been lagging far behind in terms of Covid-19 vaccination rates, which exacerbates socioeconomic inequality.

Only a meagre 20.8% of populations in low-income countries have been vaccinated with at least one dose as at Aug 3, compared to 72.2% in high-income countries.

In terms of vaccine doses, high-income and upper middle income countries have administered a total of 205.06 and 210.99 doses per 100 people respectively, while low-income countries trail far behind at 28.3 doses per 100 people, as at Aug 3.

In fact, the line representing low-income countries highlights the lagging and low rollout of Covid-19 vaccines compared to the steady increase in high-income and upper middle income countries throughout 2021.

As a result of the injustice and unfairness in the global rollout of vaccines, vaccination is projected to stretch until 2024 for populations in low-income countries – if it happens at all.

This has and will continue to adversely impact the reopening and resumption of economic activities, threatening to derail economic recovery with no clear signs of an economic rebound in the near future.

In other words, low-income countries are unable to reap the benefits of a quick and efficient rollout of vaccine programmes experienced by many high-income countries, which have helped reduce transmission, morbidity and mortality.

Worryingly, years of progress in pursuit of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in many low-income countries have been reversed.

In fact, the global drive for Covid-19 vaccination directly impacts SDG 3 regarding good health and well-being in the fight against epidemics of communicable diseases, besides contributing indirectly to another 12 out of the 17 SDGs, such as no poverty, zero hunger, quality education, decent work and economic growth, reduced inequalities, and sustainable cities and communities, among others.

Collaborative partnerships

It’s time for Malaysia to do more to address vaccine inequity, in line with the country’s historical record of championing the plight of developing and least developed nations.

Malaysia needs to remain an active player in fostering collaborative partnerships among developing countries for greater vaccine equity. Also, consistent calls for more equitable distribution and dose delivery swapping by countries which have excess supply are important.

Take for instance how our health minister highlighted that vaccines and equity have been one of the greatest moral failings in humanity’s collective response to the Covid-19 pandemic at the World Health Organization’s 72nd regional committee meeting for the western Pacific region.

Besides that, Malaysia has identified and assisted countries through the provision of Covid-19 vaccine donations. Examples of these include Bangladesh, Laos and Myanmar, which recorded low vaccination rates.

This noble initiative should continue to be pursued by the Malaysian government to ensure that low-income countries in the region and internationally are able to vaccinate a larger number of their populations.

As an aspiring global vaccine manufacturing hub, Malaysia will play a highly significant role in promoting global vaccine equity.

In fact, the Institute for Medical Research of the National Institutes of Health is currently developing Covid-19 vaccines based on inactivated viruses and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), representing the pinnacle of local vaccine research capabilities.

Moreover, Malaysian Vaccines and Pharmaceuticals Sdn Bhd is also actively producing vaccines for animals, while Pharmaniaga LifeScience is conducting the fill-and-finish of Sinovac’s Covid-19 vaccines and Solution Biologics is planning to formulate CanSinoBIO’s Covid-19 vaccines.

These exciting new developments will certainly propel Malaysia towards being a global Covid-19 vaccine producer, which goes a long way in meeting the demand for booster shots globally.

Technology transfer and investment

In the long term, Malaysia can take the second mile by actively participating in technology transfer and investment to manufacture vaccines in many more sites around the world. This move in capacity-building in developing countries will lead to greater vaccine equity.

Beyond the supply of vaccines for successful vaccination drives, low-income countries also face challenges in terms of inadequate health infrastructure, a lack of trained medical personnel, limited tracking mechanisms, and a lack of capacity to roll out and communicate vaccination programmes.

As such, Malaysia should expand its Malaysian Technical Cooperation Programme to offer technical training and capacity-building programmes in Covid-19 vaccination campaigns to low-income countries.

As Malaysia’s whole-of-government and whole-of-society’s national Covid-19 immunisation programme has been largely successful despite several initial challenges, it’s high time for Malaysia to share its expertise on the procurement of vaccines, effective communication strategies based on data and science, public-private healthcare partnership and vaccination among indigenous tribes, among others.

All in all, it’s time for Malaysia to do more to address global vaccine inequity.

As a nation which has been speaking up against injustice and inequality in the past, we need to actively champion collaborative efforts in pursuit of greater vaccine equity.

This will ensure that no individual, no community and no country is denied from reaping the fruits of the Covid-19 vaccine.

2022/0107,Article,https://leaps.org/coronavirus-vaccine-distribution/particle-3,"When the COVID-19 pandemic began invading the world in late 2019, Peter Hotez and Maria Elena Bottazzi set out to create a low-cost vaccine that would help inoculate populations in low- and middle-income countries. The scientists, with their prior experience of developing inexpensive vaccines for the world’s poor, had anticipated that the global rollout of Covid-19 jabs would be marked with several inequities. They wanted to create a patent-free vaccine to bridge this gap, but the U.S. government did not seem impressed, forcing the researchers to turn to private philanthropies for funds.

Hotez and Bottazzi, both scientists at the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine, raised about $9 million in private funds. Meanwhile, the U.S. government’s contribution stood at $400,000.

“That was a very tough time early on in the pandemic, you know, trying to do the work and raise the money for it at the same time,” says Hotez, who was nominated in February for a Nobel Peace Prize with Bottazzi for their COVID-19 vaccine. He adds that at the beginning of the pandemic, governments emphasized speed, innovation and rapidly immunizing populations in North America and Europe with little consideration for poorer countries. “We knew this [vaccine] was going to be the answer to global vaccine inequality, but I just wish the policymakers had felt the same,” says Hotez.

Over the past two years, the world has witnessed 488 million COVID-19 infections and over 61 million deaths. Over 11 billion vaccine doses have been administered worldwide; however, the global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines is marked with alarming socio-economic inequities. For instance, 72 percent of the population in high-income countries has received at least one dose of the vaccine, whereas the number stands at 15 percent in low-income countries.

This inequity is worsening vulnerabilities across the world, says Lawrence Young, a virologist and co-lead of the Warwick Health Global Research Priority at the UK-based University of Warwick. “As long as the virus continues to spread and replicate, particularly in populations who are under-vaccinated, it will throw up new variants and these will remain a continual threat even to those countries with high rates of vaccination,” says Young, “Therefore, it is in all our interests to ensure that vaccines are distributed equitably across the world.”

“When your house is on fire, you don't call the patent attorney,” says Hotez. “We wanted to be the fire department.”
The vaccine developed by Hotez and Bottazzi recently received emergency use authorisation in India, which plans to manufacture 100 million doses every month. Dubbed ‘Corbevax’ by its Indian maker, Biological E Limited, the vaccine is now being administered in India to children aged 12-14. The patent-free arrangement means that other low- and middle-income countries could also produce and distribute the vaccine locally.

“When your house is on fire, you don't call the patent attorney, you call the fire department,” says Hotez, commenting on the intellectual property rights waiver. “We wanted to be the fire department.”

The Inequity

Vaccine equity simply means that all people, irrespective of their location, should have equal access to vaccines. However, data suggests that the global COVID-19 vaccine rollout has favoured those in richer countries. For instance, high-income countries like the UAE, Portugal, Chile, Singapore, Australia, Malta, Hong Kong and Canada have partially vaccinated over 85 percent of their populations. This percentage in poorer countries, meanwhile, is abysmally low – 2.1 percent in Yemen, 4.6 in South Sudan, 5 in Cameroon, 9.9 in Burkina Faso, 10 in Nigeria, 12 in Somalia, 12 in Congo, 13 in Afghanistan and 21 in Ethiopia.The COVID-19 vaccination coverage is particularly low in African countries, and according to Shabir Madhi, a vaccinologist at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg and co-director of African Local Initiative for Vaccinology Expertise, vaccine access and inequity remains a challenge in Africa. Madhi adds that a lack of vaccine access has affected the pandemic’s trajectory on the continent, but a majority of its people have now developed immunity through natural infection. “This has come at a high cost of loss of lives,” he says.

COVID-19 vaccines mean a significant financial burden for poorer countries, which spend an average of $41 per capita annually on health, while the average cost of every COVID-19 vaccine dose ranges between $2 and $40 in addition to a distribution cost of $3.70 per person for two doses. In December last year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) set a goal of immunizing 70 percent of the population of all countries by mid-2022. This, however, means that low-income countries would have to increase their health expenditure by an average of 56.6 percent to cover the cost, as opposed to 0.8 per cent in high-income countries.

Reflecting on the factors that have driven global inequity in COVID-19 vaccine distribution, Andrea Taylor, assistant director of programs at the Duke Global Health Innovation Center, says that wealthy nations took the risk of investing heavily in the development and scaling up of COVID-19 vaccines – at a time when there was little evidence to show that vaccines would work. This reserved a place for these nations at the front of the queue when doses started rolling off production lines. Lower-income countries, meanwhile, could not afford such investments.

“Now, however, global supply is not the issue,” says Taylor. “We are making plenty of doses to meet global need. The main problem is infrastructure to get the vaccine where it is most needed in a predictable and timely way and to ensure that countries have all the support they need to store, transport, and use the vaccine once it is received.”In addition to global inequities in vaccination coverage, there are inequities within nations. Taufique Joarder, vice-chairperson of Bangladesh’s Public Health Foundation, points to the situation in his country, where vaccination coverage in rural and economically disadvantaged communities has suffered owing to weak vaccine-promotion initiatives and the difficulty many people face in registering online for jabs.

Joarder also cites the example of the COVID-19 immunization drive for children aged 12 years and above. “[Children] are given the Pfizer vaccine, which requires an ultralow temperature for storage. This is almost impossible to administer in many parts of the country, especially the rural areas. So, a large proportion of the children are being left out of vaccination,” says Joarder, adding that Corbevax, which is cheaper and requires regular temperature refrigeration “can be an excellent alternative to Pfizer for vaccinating rural children.”

Corbevax vs. mRNA Vaccines

As opposed to most other COVID-19 vaccines, which use the new Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology, Corbevax is an “old school” vaccine, says Hotez. The vaccine is made through microbial fermentation in yeast, similar to the process used to produce the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, which has been administered to children in several countries for decades. Hence, says Hotez, the technology to produce Corbevax at large scales is already in place in countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, among many others.

“So if you want to rapidly develop and produce and empower low- and middle-income countries, this is the technology to do it,” he says.

“Global access to high-quality vaccines will require serious investment in other types of COVID-19 vaccines,"" says Andrea Taylor.
The COVID-19 vaccines created by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna marked the first time that mRNA vaccine technology was approved for use. However, scientists like Young feel that there is “a need to be pragmatic and not seduced by new technologies when older, tried and tested approaches can also be effective.” Taylor, meanwhile, says that although mRNA vaccines have dominated the COVID-19 vaccine market in the U.S., “there is no clear grounding for this preference in the data we have so far.” She adds that there is also growing evidence that the immunity from these shots may not hold up as well over time as that of vaccines using different platforms.

“The mRNA vaccines are well suited to wealthy countries with sufficient ultra-cold storage and transportation infrastructure, but these vaccines are divas and do not travel well in the rest of the world,” says Taylor. “Global access to high-quality vaccines will require serious investment in other types of COVID-19 vaccines, such as the protein subunit platform used by Novavax and Corbevax. These require only standard refrigeration, can be manufactured using existing facilities all over the world, and are easy to transport.”

Joarder adds that Corbevax is cheaper due to the developers’ waived intellectual rights. It could also be used as a booster vaccine in Bangladesh, where only five per cent of the population has currently received booster doses. “If this vaccine is proved effective for heterologous boosting, [meaning] it works well and is well tolerated as a booster with other vaccines that are available in Bangladesh, this can be useful,” says Joarder.

According to Hotez, Corbevax can play several important roles - as a standalone adult or paediatric vaccine, and as a booster for other vaccines. Studies are underway to determine Corbevax’s effectiveness in these regards, he says.

Need for More Data

Biological E conducted two clinical trials involving 3000 subjects in India, and found Corbevax to be “safe and immunogenic,” with 90 percent effectiveness in preventing symptomatic infections from the original strain of COVID-19 and over 80 percent effectiveness against the Delta variant. The vaccine is currently in use in India, and according to Hotez, it’s in the pipeline at different stages in Indonesia, Bangladesh and Botswana.

However, Corbevax is yet to receive emergency use approval from the WHO. Experts such as Joarder see the need for more trials and data before it is made available to the general population. He says that while the WHO’s emergency approval is essential for global scale-up of the vaccine, we need data to determine age-stratified efficacy of the vaccine and whether it can be used for heterologous boosting with other vaccines. “According to the most recent data, the 100 percent circulating variant in Bangladesh is Omicron. We need to know how effective is Corbevax against the Omicron variant,” says Joarder.Others, meanwhile, believe that availing vaccines to poorer countries is not enough to resolve the inequity. Young, the Warwick virologist, says that the global vaccination rollout has also suffered from a degree of vaccine hesitancy, echoing similar observations by President Biden and Pfizer’s CEO. The problem can be blamed on poor communication about the benefits of vaccination. “The Corbevax vaccine [helps with the issues of] patent protection, vaccine storage and distribution, but governments need to ensure that their people are clearly informed.” Notably, however, some research has found higher vaccine willingness in lower-income countries than in the U.S.

Young also emphasized the importance of establishing local vaccination stations to improve access. For some countries, meanwhile, it may be too late. Speaking about the African continent, Madhi says that Corbevax has arrived following the peak of the crisis and won’t reverse the suffering and death that has transpired because of vaccine hoarding by high-income countries.

“The same goes for all the sudden donations from countries such as France - pretty much of little to no value when the pandemic is at its tail end,” says Madhi. “This, unfortunately, is a repeat of the swine flu pandemic in 2009, when vaccines only became available to Africa after the pandemic had very much subsided.”",https://leaps.org/media-library/scientists-at-baylor-college-of-medicine-developed-a-vaccine-called-corbevax-that-unlike-mrna-vaccines-can-be-mass-produced-using-technology-already-in-place-in-low-and-middle-income-countries-it-s-now-being-administered-in-india-to-children-aged-12-14.jpg?id=29624466&width=2000&height=1500&quality=85&coordinates=0%2C452%2C0%2C916,"April 05, 2022",Leaps.org,Can an “old school” vaccine address global inequities in Covid-19 vaccination?,

2022/0109,Article,https://www.milkenreview.org/articles/chinas-vaccine-stumble,"Don’t look now, but China has discovered soft power. Beijing, better known for its brass-knuckles tactics in dealing with neighbors from Vietnam to South Korea to Japan, is attempting to position itself as the champion of developing countries by providing free vaccines to nations that might otherwise be relegated to the end of a very long line. But this is a hard road for a country that demands fealty in almost all foreign endeavors, economic and diplomatic. And the strains are already showing, as rival India was beating China at its own game before the latest surge of Covid-19 pounded the South Asian giant.

Head Start 
Beijing approved distribution of its Covid-19 vaccines in December 2020 — a rapid rollout aided in part by mass testing on the People’s Liberation Army. By February 2021, China was exporting both the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines to 22 of the 53 countries it hoped to supply in Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. 

China’s vaccine largesse came as the World Health Organization (WHO) was struggling to assist low-income countries through its COVAX initiative. Only about two billion of an intended six billion COVAX doses are slated for distribution in 2021. And with production delays and safety concerns dogging two of its vaccines, COVAX supplies may lag the target for delivery as more affluent Western countries elbow their place in line. This gave China an opportunity to burnish its new role on the global high ground, while smoothing over bruised feelings among less-than-satisfied partner countries.

In the Balkans, where China has long sought to increase its influence, the pandemic has threatened to overwhelm the region’s fragile health systems. Beginning in the early months of 2020, China shipped free masks, medical equipment and in some instances medical staff to operate them. By the fourth quarter of 2020 it was becoming clear that Covid-19 vaccines would not be arriving any time soon from the EU, so China followed up its “mask diplomacy” with offers of vaccine.

While most Balkan countries still pinned their hopes on vaccines and financial aid from the EU, their governments didn’t look a gift horse in the mouth. For China, it was an opportunity to make amends for the Belt and Road Initiative programs’ failure to deliver on their promise of high-profile infrastructure-led economic growth in the region.

Amends were plainly in order: the BRI has been light on results and heavy on debt for its Balkan partners. A Chinese-funded highway project to connect Montenegro’s Adriatic coast to Belgrade helped push public debt from 66 percent of GDP in 2017 to nearly 80 percent in 2019, even as project deadlines were repeatedly pushed back. By 2021, the situation had deteriorated to the point that Montenegro asked the EU for help servicing its Chinese road loan. In North Macedonia, a similar Chinese-backed highway project has overrun its original deadline, with no completion date in sight.

Actually, China’s unimpressive delivery of infrastructure has an echo in criticisms of the Chinese vaccines. The first complete vaccine trial data for a Chinese vaccine wasn’t released until mid-April 2021, after which China’s top health official admitted that the efficacy of the Chinese vaccines being exported to the world was “not high.” China is currently conducting further trials to see if mixing vaccines can close the gap.

In contrast, the EU has acknowledged that COVAX is not yielding satisfactorily rapid results and promised an improved effort that includes establishing a unique delivery mechanism for the western Balkans. Given that most western Balkan countries are EU hopefuls, it’s likely they will look to Europe for help, rather than settling for the problematic Chinese vaccines.

 
China is using its vaccine diplomacy to advance local acceptance of BRI infrastructure projects stalled by cost and/or environmental concerns, as well as to bully Southeast Asian countries into withdrawing their objections to Chinese incursions in multinational waters of the oil-rich South China Sea.
 
Not surprisingly, China has been more successful in exerting its leverage in countries where likely alternative vaccine suppliers don’t exist. In the Philippines, Indonesia and Myanmar, China is using its vaccine diplomacy to advance local acceptance of BRI infrastructure projects stalled by cost and/or environmental concerns, as well as to bully Southeast Asian countries into withdrawing their objections to Chinese incursions in multinational waters of the oil-rich South China Sea. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte quickly declared that his government would stop opposing China in the territorial dispute as he begged China for preferential vaccine access.

China is also using its vaccines to reduce international opposition to its claims to Taiwan, Tibet and Hong Kong, as well as to its violent repression of predominantly Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang province. For example, Guyana and Dominica received vaccines after backing China’s “One China Policy,” while Egypt and Kyrgyzstan received their vaccines only after expressing support for China’s position toward Xinjiang.

There’s another wrinkle to China’s vaccine diplomacy. Given production constraints, China must struggle to meet its ambitious export targets while delaying the completion of vaccinating a billion-plus Chinese adults. And further complicating matters, China has drawn India into the vaccine diplomacy game.

India’s Roll-Out
Before the pandemic, India manufactured roughly 60 percent of the world’s vaccines. India’s Covid-19 vaccine roll-out, which began in January 2021, currently involves two vaccine lines: Oxford/AstraZeneca, which is manufactured under license by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India and marketed as Covishield, and Covaxin, a home-grown product developed by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in conjunction with the Indian Council of Medical Research. By late February, India had given away 6.8 million vaccine doses worldwide, dwarfing China’s largesse.

India’s vaccine maitri (vaccine friendship) is rooted in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Neighborhood First” foreign policy and has enabled other South Asian states to start vaccination drives without waiting for COVAX (or Chinese) supplies. The first recipient was tiny Bhutan, which has strong ties with India — and does not have diplomatic relations with China.

On the same day it sent vaccines to Bhutan, India gave doses of Covishield to the Maldives, reinforcing popular support for the Maldives government’s pro-India foreign policy at the expense of the country’s pro-China opposition party. India has also supplied Sunni Muslim Bangladesh with vaccine through commercial sales as well as gifts, which has helped to ease resentment over a bigoted Hindu nationalist-inspired law that gave non-Muslim immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh a priority track to citizenship.

India’s vaccine diplomacy in South Asia has proved more successful than China’s. Nepal was quick to approve Covishield while delaying authorization of China’s Sinopharm. Sri Lanka delayed approval of Sinopharm, while it had no problems with Covishield. China’s pledge to donate Sinopharm shots to Afghanistan came weeks after India gifted its Covishield vaccines to the country. In Southeast Asia, Myanmar and Cambodia requested and received Indian-produced vaccines, despite the fact that both countries have closer economic and diplomatic ties with China.

India was also garnering favorable reviews worldwide from its contributions to COVAX and other international immunization efforts. In February, Ghana became the first country to receive a COVAX shipment, which consisted of 600,000 doses of the Indian-made AstraZeneca vaccine. Then in March, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), an informal diplomatic group consisting of India, the United States, Japan and Australia, announced its own vaccine program. Its goal is to produce one billion doses in India and distribute them through Australia, with a focus on providing Southeast Asia with a more effective alternative to Chinese vaccines.

All that said, India’s ambitious plans to vaccinate much of the world has to be put on hold in mid-April by the spectacular surge in Covid-19 cases at home. There’s no reason to believe, though, that they won’t get back on track when India’s domestic woes subside.

At least at this stage, China appears to be losing the vaccine diplomacy contest. After observing India’s surprising success, a Wall Street Journal editorial noted, “There’s nothing wrong with India’s ambition to develop homegrown vaccines. But as the country’s own experience shows, India does best when it is open and collaborative — and takes a little help from its Western friends.” China might take note.",,"May 3, 2021",Milken Institute Review,China’s Vaccine Stumble,

His comments come weeks after Sinovac asked the Bangladesh government to co-fund the domestic trials, which sources said would cost roughly $7 million. Sinovac informed the health ministry in a letter, seen by Reuters, that a delay in approvals in Bangladesh had resulted in funding getting reallocated to trials in other countries.

""We are not co-funding the trial. That was not in the agreement. They never asked for money when they approached us,"" Maleque said. ""As per agreement, they'll bear all expenses of the trial, they'll give us 110,000 free vaccines and they'll share the technology so that our pharmaceutical companies can make the vaccine.""

Sinovac, which last month commenced Phase III trials on its ""CoronaVac"" vaccine in Turkey, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In the letter to the government from September, Sinovac also said it had sought funding for the trial from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) - a foundation backed by public funds and private philanthropy - but this had failed to come through.

""We are working on plans to partially rectify the funding situation by the end of October or early November,"" said the company in the letter, but stressed it would still require co-funding to complete the trial in Bangladesh.

The country's state medical research agency had given a go-ahead to the Phase III trial in July and government approval came a month later.

Maleque said Sinovac was still free to conduct the trial in Bangladesh with its own funds. ""They can conduct the trial. But we can't co-fund the trial with a private company. It has to be a government-to-government deal if we go for co-funding,"" he added.

The minister said Bangladesh was in talks with at least five frontrunners for the vaccine, including Astrazeneca. Bangladesh reported 22 deaths and 1,537 new COVID-19 infections on Tuesday, taking the total number of reported cases in the country to 381,275, and the death toll to 5,577.

""We will ensure the best vaccine for our people. We have allocated funds for that and our development partners are also eager to fund us,"" Maleque said.",https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/images/story/202010/vaccine_660_040920115131_141020091306.jpg?size=948:533,"Oct 14, 2020",BusinesToday,COVID-19 vaccine: Bangladesh to not co-fund Sinovac's late-stage trials,
2022/0111,Article,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/vaccine-diplomacy-countries-using-covid-142425196.html,"The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to various new, repurposed or newly popular terms. The newest entry to the pandemic lexicon might be “vaccine diplomacy”, with some countries using their jabs to strengthen regional ties and enhance their own power and global status.

In early February, half a million doses of the Chinese Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Pakistan, before soon also reaching 13 other countries including Cambodia, Nepal, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe. The Chinese ambassador to Pakistan declared it a “manifestation of our brotherhood”, a sentiment echoed by the Pakistani government. Russia has similarly used its own Sputnik V vaccine to win friends and support, providing access to countries as yet unable to start their own vaccination programmes.

India has been donating supplies of the AstraZeneca/Oxford jabs produced in the country to regional neighbours including Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal, bolstering not only its reputation as a supplier of cheap and accessible vaccines to the global south, but also challenging China’s efforts at regional dominance at a time of heightened tensions between the two countries.

Meanwhile, Israel has reportedly agreed to pay Russia to send the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine to the Syrian government as part of a prisoner exchange deal.

Vaccine diplomacy has also involved efforts to undermine trust in the intentions and efficacy of rival powers. China and Russia have both been accused by governments in Europe and North America of state-backed disinformation campaigns seeking to undermine trust in vaccines produced in those regions. And Russia sent supplies of Sputnik V to Hungary, in a move seen by some as designed to undermine EU unity and credibility.

Europe and North America have been late to the game in providing vaccines to poorer countries and regions. Calls from leaders such as France’s Emmanuel Macron to donate vaccines to poorer countries, and pledges from the UK to donate surplus supplies have only emerged in recent days.

Strings attached?
In the absence of providing vaccine supplies to poorer countries, some in the west sought to cast doubt on the credibility of Chinese and Russian efforts, presenting them as cynical ploys for diplomatic advantage. You may be getting vaccines, they have been telling the world, but at what cost in your obligations to Russia and China – even as western countries wrap their own international aid in conditions, often involving aspirations for trade deals.

The response to the virus has been embedded in global power and diplomatic wrangles from the very start – from the Trump administration referring to “the Chinese virus” at every turn as part of its wider political and economic struggles with China, to Chinese efforts to use its own success to enhance the legitimacy of strict measures and curbs on political and social freedoms.

Fighting disease has in fact long been used as a means for extending soft power and winning friends. Superpower rivalries for influence through the needle have sometimes even been positive: the success of the smallpox eradication campaign was in part fuelled by the rivalry between the Soviet Union and US. Responding to the Sars epidemic in 2002, China provided assistance and support to affected countries to bolster its global power status, including to Taiwan. This stands in stark contrast to its more tense relationship with Taiwan in this latest epidemic.

Such assistance has tended to accrue the most soft-power influence when aid has been seen as impartial and free from naked self-interest. Before being merged with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, for example, the reputation of the UK’s former Department for International Development (DfID) was in part enhanced by its legally enshrined focus on poverty and its autonomous status. The current round of vaccine diplomacy on all sides is neither.

The prospect of global health becoming a new arena for global power competition and rivalry should worry us all. Whatever benefits may have emerged from such rivalries in the past, they did so through cooperative rivalry. The global response to COVID-19 has thus far tended to be uncooperative and divisive, casting blame or seeking to spread distrust.

The complexities of global health, and the needs of the billions excluded from the benefits of vaccine science and innovation, demand a truly global response. Whether responding to COVID-19 will lead to a more equal partnership for health for all, or reinforce some of the worst instincts displayed during the past year, will determine not only the course of COVID-19, but the impact of the next epidemic to threaten global health, and the ones that follow that.",,"February 22, 2021",Yahoo  Finance,Vaccine diplomacy: how some countries are using COVID to enhance their soft power,
2022/0112,Article,https://www.himalmag.com/the-price-of-immunity-cost-comparison-covid19-vaccines-southasia-2021/,"the race to inoculate Southasia’s populations has been marked with delays, cost constraints, red-tapism and mistrust – shedding light on the severity of global and regional vaccine inequality. A crucial concern throughout the region has been the issue of cost; the prices that governments, and in some cases individuals, are paying for the vaccines.

While the recent news cycle has been inundated with reports of fresh supplies of vaccines, important conversations about the economics of vaccine access and availability remain unclear or misleading, given that public procurement processes for vaccines have been largely opaque, mainly through the use of Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs).

Given the paucity of information on the costs of the vaccines across the region, and the value of a cross-country comparison of these figures, we have put together the following infographic. The chart shows reported prices per dose of vaccines procured through various agreements around the region. The numbers were compiled from a range of sources, including news reports and UNICEF’s vaccine market dashboard. While this data shows a useful comparison, please note that this is a limited view given that at this stage of the vaccine rollout, it is challenging to gauge costs – with some vaccines being more expensive to produce than others and some vaccine prices remaining undisclosed. At the same time, it should be noted that some proportion of vaccines administered so far were received as grants at no cost.Meanwhile, any proposal to address the supply constraint by relying on the market appears dubious in light of reports from Pakistan, where many cannot afford vaccines at the given private market prices. The sales of vaccines in private hospitals have ranged from around USD 28 for a CanSino Biologics one-dose shot to USD 80 for two doses of the Sputnik V vaccine (of which the procurement price is nearly half this rate)  – almost four times the international market price. In March 2021, the government reversed its decision to exempt private firms from price caps. While the drug regulatory authority wanted Sputnik V to be sold at a lower price – AGP Limited, a private pharmaceutical company, won an interim court order to sell the vaccine until a final price is fixed. However, this price dispute with private importers has not only stalled the commercial administration of vaccines across private hospitals in Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore but delayed further distribution.

In India, the government made significant changes to its vaccine policy in June 2021 after a brutal second wave of COVID-19 pushed the country’s health system to its breaking point, halting all AstraZeneca vaccine exports to several countries. Under the new rules, the federal government will now procure 75 percent of all vaccines from manufacturers and allocate them to states for free, and the remaining 25 percent can be purchased by the private sector. The centre has also capped the prices of vaccines, directing private hospitals to charge fixed prices of USD 18.90 for Covaxin, USD 10.46 for Covishield and USD 15.35 for Sputnik V, per dose. Despite being developed locally, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin is currently the most expensive COVID-19 vaccine in India’s private market, attributing its high prices to the distribution costs and low procurement volumes.

Procurement costs of some other vaccines are more difficult to determine, due to the use of non-disclosure agreements. The Nepal government, for example, has signed an NDA with China-based Sinopharm, even as the country’s procurement laws do not have clear provisions for such agreements. However, according to one minister, vaccines from the company could be priced at USD 20 per two doses, though Chinese officials and Sinopharm had reportedly raised objections to reports about its pricing in Nepal as a final agreement had not been reached.

Vaccines at undisclosed prices from China have also raised questions in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka when it was reported that Sri Lanka had paid USD 5 more per dose for the Sinopharm vaccine than Bangladesh. It was later clarified by Bangladesh’s health ministry that the procurement agreement, including pricing, had not been finalised, and that they would maintain non-disclosure clauses strictly. The use of NDAs, however, is not unique to companies from China. Often, the bargaining power over price transparency is not in the hands of governments due to the patents for lifesaving vaccines being held by large pharmaceutical companies – in Trinidad and Tobago or Malaysia, for instance, Pfizer and Moderna too have required NDAs.

Given the wide disparity in vaccine production and distribution, developing countries around the world have so far relied on grants and facilities like the COVAX initiative for inoculating their populations. In light of this, Southasia has a long way to go in terms of vaccine rollout – which means the region will continue to grapple with the effects of COVID-19 and its variants.",https://www.himalmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/coronavirus-6165345_1920-1.jpg,"Jul 22, 2021",HIMAL SOUTHASIAN,The price of immunity,

Option 1: Learn more about the human impact of global vaccine inequality

In “Some Nations Could Wait Years for Covid Shots. That’s Bad for Everyone.” Abdi Latif Dahir and Benjamin Mueller write that while richer places, such as the U.S., hope to vaccinate most of their citizens within months, poorer countries, like Kenya, expect to reach just small fractions of their populations in that time:

NAIROBI, Kenya — The nurse lay in bed this month, coughing, wheezing and dizzy with fever.

It was three months after rich countries began vaccinating health workers, but Kenyans like the nurse, Stella Githaiga, had been left behind: Employed in the country’s largest public hospital, she caught the coronavirus on an outreach trip to remote communities in February, she believes, sidelining her even as Kenya struggles with a vicious third surge of infections.

Ms. Githaiga and her colleagues are victims of one of the most galling inequities in a pandemic that has exposed so many: Across the global south, health workers are being sickened and killed by a virus from which doctors and nurses in many rich countries are now largely protected.

2022/0114,Article,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/world/vaccine-patents-us-eu.html,"In the coming days, a patent will finally be issued on a five-year-old invention, a feat of molecular engineering that is at the heart of at least five major Covid-19 vaccines. And the United States government will control that patent.

The new patent presents an opportunity — and some argue the last best chance — to exact leverage over the drug companies producing the vaccines and pressure them to expand access to less affluent countries.

The question is whether the government will do anything at all.

The rapid development of Covid-19 vaccines, achieved at record speed and financed by massive public funding in the United States, the European Union and Britain, represents a great triumph of the pandemic. Governments partnered with drugmakers, pouring in billions of dollars to procure raw materials, finance clinical trials and retrofit factories. Billions more were committed to buy the finished product.

But this Western success has created stark inequity. Residents of wealthy and middle-income countries have received about 90 percent of the nearly 400 million vaccines delivered so far. Under current projections, many of the rest will have to wait years.

Growing numbers of health officials and advocacy groups worldwide are calling for Western governments to use aggressive powers — most of them rarely or never used before — to force companies to publish vaccine recipes, share their know-how and ramp up manufacturing. Public health advocates have pleaded for help, including asking the Biden administration to use its patent to push for broader vaccine access.

Governments have resisted. By partnering with drug companies, Western leaders bought their way to the front of the line. But they also ignored years of warnings — and explicit calls from the World Health Organization — to include contract language that would have guaranteed doses for poor countries or encouraged companies to share their knowledge and the patents they control.

“It was like a run on toilet paper. Everybody was like, ‘Get out of my way. I’m gonna get that last package of Charmin,’” said Gregg Gonsalves, a Yale epidemiologist. “We just ran for the doses.”The prospect of billions of people waiting years to be vaccinated poses a health threat to even the richest countries. One example: In Britain, where the vaccine rollout has been strong, health officials are tracking a virus variant that emerged in South Africa, where vaccine coverage is weak. That variant may be able to blunt the effect of vaccines, meaning even vaccinated people might get sick.

Western health officials said they never intended to exclude others. But with their own countries facing massive death tolls, the focus was at home. Patent sharing, they said, simply never came up.

“It was U.S.-centric. It wasn’t anti-global.” said Moncef Slaoui, who was the chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, a Trump administration program that funded the search for vaccines in the United States. “Everybody was in agreement that vaccine doses, once the U.S. is served, will go elsewhere.”

President Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Union’s executive branch, are reluctant to change course. Mr. Biden has promised to help an Indian company produce about 1 billion doses by the end of 2022 and his administration has donated doses to Mexico and Canada. But he has made it clear that his focus is at home.

“We’re going to start off making sure Americans are taken care of first,” Mr. Biden said recently. “But we’re then going to try and help the rest of the world.”

Pressuring companies to share patents could be seen as undermining innovation, sabotaging drugmakers or picking drawn-out and expensive fights with the very companies digging a way out of the pandemic.

As rich countries fight to keep things as they are, others like South Africa and India have taken the battle to the World Trade Organization, seeking a waiver on patent restrictions for Covid-19 vaccines.

Russia and China, meanwhile, have promised to fill the void as part of their vaccine diplomacy. The Gamaleya Institute in Moscow, for example, has entered into partnerships with producers from Kazakhstan to South Korea, according to data from Airfinity, a science analytics company, and UNICEF. Chinese vaccine makers have reached similar deals in the United Arab Emirates, Brazil and Indonesia.Addressing patents would not, by itself, solve the vaccine imbalance. Retrofitting or constructing factories would take time. More raw materials would need to be manufactured. Regulators would have to approve new assembly lines.

Boosters: The Biden administration plans to offer updated doses of the vaccine targeting the versions of the virus now predominant in the United States to Americans 12 and older soon after Labor Day.
Fauci to Step Down: Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s top medical adviser who was catapulted into the spotlight at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, said he would leave government service by the end of the year.
New Guidelines: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention loosened its Covid-19 guidance, saying those exposed to the virus no longer need to quarantine.
A Sweeping Rebuke: Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that her agency had failed to respond quickly enough to the coronavirus pandemic and needed to be overhauled.
And as with cooking a complicated dish, giving someone a list of ingredients is no substitute to showing them how to make it.

To address these problems, the World Health Organization created a technology pool last year to encourage companies to share know-how with manufacturers in lower-income nations.

Not a single vaccine company has signed up.

“The problem is that the companies don’t want to do it. And the government is just not very tough with the companies,” said James Love, who leads Knowledge Ecology International, a nonprofit.

Drug company executives told European lawmakers recently that they were licensing their vaccines as quickly as possible, but that finding partners with the right technology was challenging.

“They don’t have the equipment,” Moderna’s chief executive, Stéphane Bancel, said. “There is no capacity.”

But manufacturers from Canada to Bangladesh say they can make vaccines — they just lack patent licensing deals. When the price is right, companies have shared secrets with new manufacturers in just months, ramping up production and retrofitting factories.It helps when the government sweetens the deal. Earlier this month, Mr. Biden announced that the pharmaceutical giant Merck would help make vaccines for its competitor Johnson & Johnson. The government pressured Johnson & Johnson to accept the help and is using wartime procurement powers to secure supplies for the company. It will also pay to retrofit Merck’s production line, with an eye toward making vaccines available to every adult in the United States by May.

Despite the hefty government funding, drug companies control nearly all of the intellectual property and stand to make fortunes off the vaccines. A critical exception is the patent expected to be approved soon — a government-led discovery for manipulating a key coronavirus protein.

This breakthrough, at the center of the 2020 race for a vaccine, actually came years earlier in a National Institutes of Health lab, where an American scientist named Dr. Barney Graham was in pursuit of a medical moonshot.

‘We’d already done everything’
For years, Dr. Graham specialized in the kind of long, expensive research that only governments bankroll. He searched for a key to unlock universal vaccines — genetic blueprints to be used against any of the roughly two dozen viral families that infect humans. When a new virus emerged, scientists could simply tweak the code and quickly make a vaccine.

In 2016, while working on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, another coronavirus known as MERS, he and his colleagues developed a way to swap a pair of amino acids in the coronavirus spike protein. That bit of molecular engineering, they realized, could be used to develop effective vaccines against any coronavirus. The government, along with its partners at Dartmouth College and the Scripps Research Institute, filed for a patent, which will be issued this month.

When Chinese scientists published the genetic code of the new coronavirus in January 2020, Dr. Graham’s team had their cookbook ready.

“We kind of knew exactly what we had to do,” said Jason McLellan, one of the inventors, who now works at the University of Texas at Austin. “We’d already done everything.”

Dr. Graham was already working with Moderna on a vaccine for another virus when the outbreak in China inspired his team to change focus. “We just flipped it to coronavirus and said, ‘How fast can we go?’” Dr. Graham recalled.Within a few days, they emailed the vaccine’s genetic blueprint to Moderna to begin manufacturing. By late February, Moderna had produced enough vaccines for government-run clinical trials.

“We did the front end. They did the middle. And we did the back end,” Dr. Graham said.

Exactly who holds patents for which vaccines won’t be sorted out for months or years. But it is clear now that several of today’s vaccines — including those from Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, CureVac and Pfizer-BioNTech — rely on the 2016 invention. Of those, only BioNTech has paid the U.S. government to license the technology. The patent is scheduled to be issued March 30.

Patent lawyers and public health advocates say it’s likely that other companies will either have to negotiate a licensing agreement with the government, or face the prospect of a lawsuit worth billions. The government filed such a lawsuit in 2019 against the drugmaker Gilead over H.I.V. medication.

This gives the Biden administration leverage to force companies to share technology and expand worldwide production, said Christopher J. Morten, a New York University law professor specializing in medical patents.

“We can do this the hard way, where we sue you for patent infringement,” he said the government could assert. “Or just play nice with us and license your tech.”

The National Institutes of Health declined to comment on its discussions with the drugmakers but said it did not anticipate a dispute over patent infringement. None of the drug companies responded to repeated questions about the 2016 patent.

Experts said the government has stronger leverage on the Moderna vaccine, which was almost entirely funded by taxpayers. New mRNA vaccines, such as those from Moderna, are relatively easier to manufacture than vaccines that rely on live viruses. Scientists compare it to an old-fashioned cassette player: Try one tape. If it’s not right, just pop in another.

Moderna expects $18.4 billion in vaccine sales this year, but it is the delivery system — the cassette player — that is its most prized secret. Disclosing it could mean giving away the key to the company’s future.In May, the leaders of Pakistan, Ghana, South Africa and others called for governments to support a “people’s vaccine” that could be quickly manufactured and given for free.

They urged the governing body of the World Health Organization to treat vaccines as “global public goods.”

Though such a declaration would have had no teeth, the Trump administration moved swiftly to block it. Intent on protecting intellectual property, the government said calls for equitable access to vaccines and treatments sent “the wrong message to innovators.”

World leaders ultimately approved a watered-down declaration that recognized extensive immunization — not the vaccines themselves — as a global public good.

That same month, the World Health Organization launched the technology-access pool and called on governments to include clauses in their drug contracts guaranteeing equitable distribution. But the world’s richest nations roundly ignored the call.

In the United States, Operation Warp Speed went on a summertime spending spree, disbursing over $10 billion to handpicked companies and absorbing the financial risks of bringing a vaccine to market.

“Our role was to enable the private sector to be successful,” said Paul Mango, a top adviser to the then health secretary, Alex M. Azar II.

The deals came with few strings attached.Large chunks of the contracts are redacted and some remain secret. But public records show that the government used unusual contracts that omitted its right to take over intellectual property or influence the price and availability of vaccines. They did not let the government compel companies to share their technology.

British and other European leaders made similar concessions as they ordered enough doses to vaccinate their populations multiple times over.

“You have to write the rules of the game, and the place to do that would have been these funding contracts,” said Ellen ’t Hoen, the director of Medicines Law and Policy, an international research group.

By comparison, one of the world’s largest health financiers, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, includes grant language requiring equitable access to vaccines. As leverage, the organization retains some right to the intellectual property.

Dr. Slaoui, who came to Warp Speed after leading research and development at GlaxoSmithKline, is sympathetic to this idea. But it would have been impractical to demand patent concessions and still deliver on the program’s primary goals of speed and volume, he said.

“I can guarantee you that the agreements with the companies would have been much more complex and taken a much longer time,” he said. The European Union, for example, haggled over price and liability provisions, which delayed the rollout.

In some ways, this was a trip down a trodden path. When the H1N1 “swine flu” pandemic broke out in 2009, the wealthiest countries cornered the global vaccine market and all but locked out the rest of the world.

Experts said at the time that this was a chance to rethink the approach. But the swine flu pandemic fizzled and governments ended up destroying the vaccines they had hoarded. They then forgot to prepare for the future.

The International View
For months, the United States and European Union have blocked a proposal at the World Trade Organization that would waive intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines and treatments. The application, put forward by South Africa and India with support from most developing nations, has been bogged down in procedural hearings.

“Every minute we are deadlocked in the negotiating room, people are dying,” said Mustaqeem De Gama, a South African diplomat who is involved in the talks.

But in Brussels and Washington, leaders are still worried about undermining innovation.

During the presidential campaign, Mr. Biden’s team gathered top intellectual property lawyers to discuss ways to increase vaccine production.

“They were planning on taking the international view on things,” said Ana Santos Rutschman, a Saint Louis University law professor who participated in the sessions.

Most of the options were politically thorny. Among them was the use of a federal law allowing the government to seize a company’s patent and give it to another in order to increase supply. Former campaign advisers say the Biden camp was lukewarm to this proposal and others that called for a broader exercise of its powers.

The administration has instead promised to give $4 billion to Covax, the global vaccine alliance. The European Union has given nearly $1 billion so far. But Covax aims to vaccinate only 20 percent of people in the world’s poorest countries this year, and faces a $2 billion shortfall even to accomplish that.

Dr. Graham, the N.I.H. scientist whose team cracked the coronavirus vaccine code for Moderna, said that pandemic preparedness and vaccine development should be international collaborations, not competitions.

“A lot of this would not have happened unless there was a big infusion of government money,” he said.

But governments cannot afford to sabotage companies that need profit to survive.

Dr. Graham has largely moved on from studying the coronavirus. He is searching for a universal flu vaccine, a silver bullet that could prevent all strains of the disease without an annual tweak.

Though he was vaccinated through work, he spent the early part of the year trying to get his wife and grown children onto waiting lists — an ordeal that even one of the key inventors had to endure. “You can imagine how aggravating that is,” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/03/21/world/xxVACCINE-IP1/merlin_184877346_b59a5804-ff16-4ce4-b503-5ca2b95ba768-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp,"March 21, 2021",The New York Times,Rich Countries Signed Away a Chance to Vaccinate the World,
2022/0115,Article,News,"NEW DELHI, Dec 10 – India has been lauded for mitigating the Covid-19 outbreak by ramping up the production and distribution of vaccines. Some richer countries did the opposite by hoarding or stockpiling jabs.

But New Delhi’s efforts have advanced the country’s diplomatic and commercial interests at the expense of global health priorities.

When the pandemic hit, India found itself in an advantageous position to react to the regional need for vaccines, thanks to its large pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities.

New Delhi embarked on an ambitious vaccine diplomacy initiative (Vaccine Maitri) through which 66 million vaccines were donated or sold to 95 countries.

Both Covishield and Covaxin, vaccines produced by the Serum Institute (SII) and Bharat Biotech, were sent to India’s neighbours and further afield to countries in Africa and the Caribbean.

However, India’s vaccine diplomacy could have reaped greater dividends in vaccine equity, particularly to provide reliable access to vaccines for developing countries, had it used the opportunity to do so.

Instead, it allowed foreign policy considerations to impact decisions.

Vaccines became a source of competition in a crowded geopolitical context in South Asia. Countering China’s influence was a priority, among others.

A third of India’s vaccine shipments went to South Asian countries, ostensibly to mend deteriorating ties with Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

These countries have all more recently deepened relations with China. Beijing more recently provided funding to realise various development projects, including support to manufacture Chinese vaccines domestically, procuring testing kits, PPEs and rebuilding health infrastructures during the pandemic.Developing indigenous vaccines allowed India an opportunity to check China’s overtures, reverse Beijing’s recent gains and increase its goodwill.

China was also among the first to engage in vaccine diplomacy, particularly for developing countries.

Their head start on developing vaccines and the rapid distribution possibly spurred Indian efforts, and New Delhi stepped into this context with a more viable vaccine that it could ship with relative ease.

Evidence that China’s Covid-19 vaccines proved spotty potentially furthered India’s goals as Indian vaccines generally had fewer efficacy doubts.

India’s COVAX Commitment 

India was a vaccine juggernaut even before the pandemic.

Two-thirds of the world’s children are protected by India’s famed SII vaccines, as it produces 60 per cent of global vaccines for diseases like measles, tetanus, diphtheria and hepatitis.

The coronavirus gave the industry a new mission — to produce Covid-19 vaccines, including Covishield, the brand name for the locally produced AstraZeneca jab.

Vaccines also gave the Indian government a way to exercise its capability as a crisis-responder in South Asia and provide immediate solutions to problems, like Covid-19.

However, vaccine exports were contingent on having enough domestic stock to immunise Indian citizens.It also created pressure to balance competing needs – including the stockpiling of vaccines for India should third waves and fourth waves hit.

In late 2020, SII was enlisted by COVAX, the multilateral vaccine facility created by Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) and the Gates Foundation, to get low-and-middle-income countries vaccinated.

COVAX’s mission was to deliver fair and equitable access to safe Covid-19 vaccines, particularly to developing countries that could not buy them on the open market. Covishield became the backbone of the COVAX vaccine-sharing programme, given the difficulty of procuring Moderna/Pfizer vaccines for developing countries.

SII, which receives financial support from the Gates Foundation, pledged to manufacture and deliver 200 million Covishield doses to 64 lower-income COVAX economies alongside its commitments to the Indian government.

Of the 200 million, 110 million doses were set to be delivered between February and May 2021 to COVAX.

But only 30 million Covishield doses were delivered to COVAX for distribution due to increased domestic need during the second COVID-19 wave.

By mid-April 2021, the Indian government committed to only 20 million Covishield doses through COVAX, while exporting nearly 47 million doses bilaterally. 

Two factors intervened — first, the second wave placed a huge demand on domestic vaccinations and it became impossible to supply the amount COVAX required given constraints imposed by the government.

And second, SII gave half of its Covishield stock to the Indian government, which shipped them abroad as donations and exports.

Nearly half of India’s vaccine exports were commercial deals, some made with diplomatic objectives in mind, particularly in Nepal and Sri Lanka. Official government figures show that commercial deals have since grown to more than 50 per cent.The Larger Impact

COVAX appears to have been undermined as recipient countries felt it had to  procure doses quicker through bilateral agreements due to delays and competing pressures of multilateral facilities.

The initiative’s efficacy and success fundamentally hinged on vaccine producing countries like India sublimating their domestic interests to that of global health needs.

COVAX’s reliance on SII’s Covishield relative to other vaccines, which made the abrupt drop in supply devastating.

But more than just access to existing vaccine supplies, India’s vaccine diplomacy furthered the private provision of vaccines.

This trend gave countries with the financial means to scramble and make deals with vaccine manufacturers directly rather than supplying COVAX or having COVAX negotiate prices with vaccine manufacturers. 

India’s importance to COVAX was not just as a vaccine supplier but also as a force that would prioritise vaccine equity through a global collective just when the United States and European nations were investing in national efforts to produce and hoard vaccines.

India could have concurrently prioritised delivering vaccines to COVAX alongside its vaccine diplomacy before the second COVID-19 wave hit given rising vaccine nationalism globally.

For poorer countries, lack of access to vaccines and a lack of means to procure them was a big constraint and remains so today.

Vaccines have been a lifeline during the pandemic and had India focused more on COVAX before the second wave struck, it would have given these countries additional life-saving vaccines and made nations less reliant on the market.",https://codeblue.galencentre.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IndiaCovid.jpg,10 December 2021,CodeBlue,India’s Vaccine Diplomacy Put Politics Before People,
2022/0116,Article,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/commentary/india-vaccine-diplomacy-serum-astra-zeneca-oxford-covax-china-326351,"NEW DELHI: As countries scramble to secure COVID-19 vaccines, ugly expressions like “vaccine race” and “vaccine nationalism” have entered the global lexicon.

But, at a time when global cooperation in sharing vaccines is minimal, and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) vaccine-distribution plans are yet to get off the ground, India has taken a different tack, quietly pursuing “vaccine diplomacy.”

Its “Vaccine Maitri” (Vaccine Friendship) campaign has shipped hundreds of thousands of Indian-made Covishield vaccines, manufactured under license from Oxford-AstraZeneca, to some 60 countries.

READ: Commentary: COVID-19 vaccine deployment may be messy, but will reshape health systems for good
India is a global pharmaceutical powerhouse, manufacturing some 20 per cent of all generic medicines and accounting for as much as 62 per cent of global vaccine production, so it was quick off the mark when the pandemic struck.

Before COVID-19 vaccines were developed, India supplied some 100 countries with hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol, and sent pharmaceuticals, test kits, and other equipment to around 90 countries.

VACCINES EXPORTED

Later, even before the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was approved, Adar Poonawalla, the 40-year-old head of the privately-owned Serum Institute of India (SII), audaciously decided to manufacture it – a billion-dollar gamble.

When approvals came, SII was able to churn out millions of doses, making them available to the government both for domestic use and export.Indian vaccines have been flown to most of the country’s neighbours, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Myanmar, and Nepal, and also farther afield, to the Seychelles, Cambodia, Mongolia, and Pacific Island, Caribbean, and African countries.

Vaccines have helped mend strained relations with Bangladesh and cement friendly ties with the Maldives.

To be sure, China and Russia are promoting their own vaccines, and Western drug companies are raking in a publicity bonanza - along with a share-price windfall.

But in developing vaccines for its own use, the Global North overlooked the prohibitive cost of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for poorer countries. Indian-made vaccines, on the other hand, are reportedly safe, cost-effective, and – unlike some others – do not require storage and transport at very low temperatures.

GEOPOLITICAL AIMS

India’s vaccine diplomacy is, of course, not purely altruistic.

When the country’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, laid the foundations of India’s science and technology infrastructure, his intentions were expressed in noble, humanist, and universalist terms.Trudeau effusively declared that the world’s victory over COVID-19 would be “because of India’s tremendous pharmaceutical capacity, and Prime Minister Modi’s leadership in sharing this capacity with the world.”

India is using the country’s capacity in this sector subtly to advertise an alternative to China’s economic and geopolitical dominance.

While China has been secretive in releasing data about its vaccines, leading to controversies over the efficacy of them, India organised trips for foreign ambassadors to visit pharmaceutical factories in Pune and Hyderabad.

READ: Commentary: World needs a lot more COVID-19 vaccine doses than this
The contrast with the behaviour of wealthier countries is no less striking.

According to Duke University’s Global Health Institute, developed countries with 16 per cent of the world’s population – including Canada, the United States, and the UK, each of whom have guaranteed enough supplies to vaccinate their populations several times over – have secured 60 per cent of global vaccine supplies for themselves.

Other countries commandeering supplies exceeding their domestic needs include Australia, Chile, and several European Union members.

The world is paying attention to India as it shares its available vaccine supplies, instead of choosing the nationalist course of blocking exports.

India has also offered 1.1 billion vaccine doses to the WHO’s COVAX program to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to poorer countries.

AT ITS OWN EXPENSE

As Modi has tweeted, “We are all together in the fight against this pandemic. India is committed to sharing resources, experiences, and knowledge for global good.”

If there is a concern, it is that India has exported three times as many doses as it has administered to its own people.

The country is lagging behind its own target of immunising 300 million people by August, after vaccinating some three million health-care workers in a campaign that began on Jan 16.

And mounting concern about rising case numbers, the emergence of COVID-19 variants that may not respond to existing vaccines, and an economy that has not yet fully recovered, will intensify the challenge India confronts in fulfilling its obligations to developing countries while also meeting domestic demand.

Meeting that challenge is a vital national interest.

India’s vaccine diplomacy has been a boon to the country’s aspirations to be recognised as a global power.

In combating the pandemic, it has gone well beyond the routine provision of health care or the supply of generics.

The World Health Organization said every country that had fully immunised more than 40 per cent of its population was doing too little to stop the Covid-19 crisis, as they should be ensuring doses go to nations left wide open to the virus.

The WHO wanted 10 per cent of the population in every country fully jabbed by the end of September-a target missed in 56 countries, ""through no fault of their own"", said the organisation's chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

The UN health agency said 1.5 billion vaccine doses were now being manufactured every month-with less than one week's production needed to reach the 10 per cent target.

""Vaccine inequality is aiding and abetting the Covid-19 pandemic,"" Guterres told a virtual press conference alongside Tedros.

""It is allowing variants to develop and run wild, condemning the world to millions more deaths, and prolonging an economic slowdown that could cost trillions of dollars.""

Guterres said that if the virus spread in areas with few vaccinated people, the greater the chances of a variant emerging that could become resistant to vaccines.

It is something of a public-relations own goal—a reminder of how the altruism that China’s “vaccine diplomacy” is intended to showcase is often undermined by grubbier calculations and missteps. Months ago China recognised that rich countries would be too busy getting their own populations jabbed to give serious thought to poorer places. China could both earn gratitude and present itself as a scientific, diplomatic and even moral powerhouse. More cynically, vaccine diplomacy was a tool to rewrite history: to change the narrative of China as the source of the plague to the world’s saviour from it.

Urged on by President Xi Jinping, the state pumped money into vaccine development and signed deals with dozens of countries. With vaccines that its leaders claimed would be cheaper and easier to store than those being developed in the West, China would change the course of the pandemic. The two leading producers, Sinovac and Sinopharm, claimed to be able to produce 2bn doses a year between them.

Yet China’s vaccine diplomacy has stumbled, and not only because of delayed production and shipment. China’s eagerness for countries to take its vaccines is matched by its reluctance to share the data from clinical trials. That is presumably because Chinese vaccines are less effective than Western ones. It all erodes trust. Singapore paid for the option of the Sinovac shot, among several ordered from around the world. Yet China “blew it”, in the words of an insider, when its embassy trumpeted the arrival of a Sinovac consignment last month before the Singaporean government had approved the drug. It will not do that without the data China declines to provide.

The Philippine government, which threw in its lot with China when coronavirus vaccinations began in March, is struggling to persuade a population badly hit by the pandemic to accept Chinese jabs. A scandal concerning a black market for unregulated shots, aimed mainly at Chinese workers, has not helped. Nor has the recent discovery of 200 Chinese vessels occupying a reef within what the Philippines considers its territorial waters. China, says Ronald Mendoza of Ateneo de Manila University, is not doing well at winning hearts and minds.

China has not blown it everywhere. A Chinese shot in the arm is surely much better than none at all. And countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia, which did not secure enough Western vaccines, are glad of Chinese help. Yet China is not the only Asian country capable of mass-producing vaccines and hoping to generate goodwill as a consequence. India is a vaccine giant, sitting at the heart of medical supply chains. Its manufacturers already play a big role in the production of AstraZeneca’s vaccine against covid-19. Russia depends on India for the global roll-out of its Sputnik vaccine.India has been ramping up shipments to neighbours such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. In fact, it has exported more doses (60m) than it has used at home (44m). In theory, its vaccine diplomacy was turbocharged at a recent virtual summit of the “Quad” grouping of Australia, India, Japan and the United States. The foursome agreed to fund the production of 1bn Indian-made vaccines for distribution to countries in need by the end of 2022.

Yet even more than China, India faces a tension between vaccinating its own vast population and helping other countries. A suffocatingly statist approach that initially excluded the private sector meant a slow start to its own vaccination programme, especially among the poor. This week it froze all exports of the AstraZeneca vaccine to ensure bigger supplies at home, amid a surging second wave of infections—an own goal of its own.

Shivshankar Menon, a former Indian foreign secretary, doubts that efforts at vaccine diplomacy alone, even when deftly handled, will do much to increase either China or India’s influence or standing. People see through claims of altruism, he says. But at least the Quad reflects an effort to do something for the global good—a collective response that has been all too rare in this pandemic.

2022/0120,Article,https://www.controlrisks.com/our-thinking/insights/covid19-vaccine-diplomacy-from-nationalism-to-friendship,"COVID-19 vaccination campaigns have started in earnest in 2021. However, rollouts are having divergent impacts on diplomatic relations between states with some countries prioritising domestic vaccine rollouts and others sending a large number of doses overseas. 


Vaccine nationalism
Israel, the UAE, the UK, the US and Bahrain are leading the pack in doses administered per capita. Successful rollouts may bolster or restore domestic confidence in these governments, some of whose reputations have been battered by accusations of pandemic mismanagement. On the international stage, the reaction could be very different. 

Citing a “me first” approach to vaccine distribution, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on 18 January said that the world was “on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure”. A minority of wealthy countries – particularly in Europe and North America – have pre-purchased the majority of vaccine doses currently under order. Although other countries are increasing their purchases, many will have to wait until the second or third quarter of 2021 to ramp up much smaller vaccination campaigns. “Vaccine nationalism” has the potential to delay these campaigns further, fragment the global recovery to the pandemic, and even undermine multilateral cooperation on other issues.

India and South Africa in October requested that the World Trade Organization (WTO) waive parts of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), arguing that IP rights are inhibiting the scaling up of vaccine production. Opponents – mostly in Europe and the US – have argued that this will not resolve manufacturing and distribution bottlenecks. As more vaccines produced in the US and Europe come online, refusal to waive IP rights will remain a significant area of tension. 

The “me first” approach also has the potential to exacerbate tensions between countries that have purchased large numbers of doses from the same supplier. Following a dispute with one supplier, the European Commission (EC) on 29 January moved to impose export controls on vaccines entering part of the UK (Northern Ireland) via EU member state Ireland. Outrage in Belfast, London and Dublin over the EC’s effective imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – a longstanding area of diplomatic concern – led the EC to swiftly backtrack. The EU now requires vaccine producers to seek permission from member states before supplying doses beyond the bloc in many circumstances, a move that could limit exports to other regions.

The spat also saw European officials question the efficacy of one vaccine in elderly populations, with French President Emmanuel Macron describing it as “quasi-ineffective” in the demographic. The politicisation of particular vaccines as a result of diplomatic disputes has undermined confidence in vaccination among some citizens who are already hesitant to roll up their sleeves.

Vaccine diplomacy
Such squabbles stand in stark contrast to the way in which other states are increasingly leveraging vaccines as a tool of diplomacy. 

China
China has pledged to make its domestically manufactured vaccines a “global public good” and is promoting them as a tool to strengthen its global image. The country’s foreign ministry on 25 February announced that it is providing aid in the form of COVID-19 vaccines to 53 countries. It is also exporting vaccines on commercial terms, including to some countries that hosted clinical trials in 2020.

Beijing will continue to leverage its vaccine diplomacy to gain geopolitical sway in key regions, including South-East Asia. It will help to entrench China’s relationships in the Gulf, where thanks in part to Chinese vaccines, the UAE and Bahrain are among the world leaders in vaccination per capita.

The country’s vaccine outreach has not been without hiccups. Neither the Chinese government nor developers have released as much clinical trial data as their European and US counterparts. This has raised concerns among some prospective buyers about vaccine efficacy. While data from Turkey suggested that a vaccine produced by China’s Sinovac has an efficacy rate of 91%, Brazil put the figure closer to 50%. A continued lack of transparency could undermine global uptake.

India
India already manufactures approximately 60% of the world’s vaccines for various diseases and has been described as “the world’s pharmacy”. The Serum Institute of India has signed deals to produce billions of doses of vaccines developed by Western companies. At the UN General Assembly in September 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave assurances that the country’s vaccine production capacity would be used to “help all humanity”. Throughout the pandemic India has sent medication, COVID-19 testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE) globally, including to wealthy countries such as the US and Israel.

India has demonstrated its “vaccine friendship” by delivering free doses to its regional neighbours (including Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Seychelles, Mauritius and the Maldives) within days of starting its own domestic vaccination campaign in mid-January. It has now reportedly exported three times as many doses as it has administered at home. India’s vaccine diplomacy is also being extended to other countries and regions where Beijing has a strong geopolitical footprint with New Delhi readying supplies to Cambodia, Mongolia, and the Caribbean and Pacific Island states.  

Russia
Russia is seeking to leverage its Sputnik V vaccine to demonstrate its scientific prowess. The vaccine was granted domestic regulatory approval in August 2020, despite not having completed phase three clinical trials at the time. President Vladimir Putin almost certainly made the somewhat premature announcement to secure a soft power coup. With some 1bn doses on order globally, Moscow will use the deployment of Sputnik V to expand Russia’s influence. Notably, Hungary on 21 January authorised its use, reflecting growing impatience with the speed of the EU’s vaccine rollout – another diplomatic coup for the Kremlin as relations with Brussels deteriorate over other issues.

Western diplomacy
In China and India, COVID-19 infection rates have remained persistently and respectively extremely low and falling for several months. This has alleviated pressure for quick domestic vaccination campaigns and made vaccine grants more feasible. The same cannot be said for the US and Europe where infection rates peaked into the start of the new year and are only falling now. In the coming weeks, Western governments will continue to prioritise national vaccination campaigns over charitable overseas outreach, in the hope that this will ease pressure on healthcare services and allow for some loosening of restrictions.

During this time, they will likely seek to counter the narrative that they are hoarding doses at the expense of the rest of the world. They have already committed large donations to the multilateral COVAX initiative and will also use it as the primary conduit to support low- and middle-income countries. At a virtual summit of the G7 on 19 February, leaders increased their financial commitments to the scheme. This included USD 4bn from the US after the new administration of Joe Biden committed to joining the scheme eschewed by his predecessor – a major boost to COVAX’s prospects and multilateral action on the pandemic. 

Nevertheless, COVAX only delivered its first shots on 23 February and its distribution will take time to ramp up. As wealthy Western countries complete vaccination of their most at-risk populations and key workers, pressure (including from some domestic constituencies) will mount for them to share some of their purchased supplies with other countries. On the eve of the G7 meeting, Macron proposed that members of the group provide up to 5% of their vaccines to poorer countries. At the meeting itself, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to donate surplus doses.  

A new strain on relations
However, the arrival of concerning COVID-19 variants may upset current or prospective vaccine diplomacy. Reports have emerged to suggest that some vaccines may be less effective against existing more virulent strains. This increases the likelihood that booster shots will be needed and – in wealthy countries – deployed. Meanwhile, at-risk citizens in low-income countries will still be waiting for their first doses. As the rollout ramps up, concerns about equity and fairness will become an ever-greater fault line in international relations. Those that do not treat vaccines as a “global public good” will face criticism, especially as the virus continues to mutate outside their borders.",,03 Mar 2021,Control Risks,COVID-19 vaccine diplomacy – from nationalism to friendship,

Sky News analysis has found 47 countries, plus the African Union which represents 55 nations, have made or been offered vaccine deals with India, China and Russia.

In 21 countries, their sole vaccine supplies up until 19 February were from Russia, China and India.In another 16 countries, half or more of the doses agreed are from those three countries, data from science analytics company Airfinity shows.

Most of those vaccines are from China and Russia but some in Africa and Asia are from India.

However, the vast majority of the world's COVID-19 vaccines are not from Russia, China and India, with just one in 10 doses from them. Their main purpose is to impose their influence, experts have said.Agathe Demarais, global forecasting director at the Economist Intelligence Unit, told Sky News: ""What Russia and China are trying to do is to bolster their global standing.

""They've been doing this for decades but both leaderships are seizing this opportunity to further their standing - it's a brick in the whole ground plan.""

Ms Demarais, who is also a former French diplomat in Russia and the Middle East, added that it is a long-term strategy so whether they are rich or poor is not necessarily the most important issue, it is whether they can impose their influence.

""Bolstering long-term global presence will give them leverage over emerging countries, when you're receiving vaccines from Russia and China, they will have small requests that you can't say no to,"" she added.

""Russia and China are presenting themselves as saviours but there's a risk - they have had production issues, they're struggling to vaccinate their own populations so there's a big concern they will overpromise and underdeliver.""

China and Russia are not only providing vaccines to countries but they are also providing factories to make them and workers as part of their long-term strategy in some nations.

India, which is only producing vaccines in India, is targeting neighbouring countries and is trying to beat China to them, development expert Dr Subir Sinha from The School of Oriental & African Studies, University of London said.

He belives there is another strand of vaccine diplomacy for India in that the prime minister, Narendra Modi, wants to be seen on the world stage as a man of ""great generosity"".

However, with the roll-out within India going slowly and some states refusing to administer the Indian-made Covivax vaccine due to efficacy concerns, there is a question over how far India's vaccine diplomacy can go.

COVAX, the initiative aimed at ensuring all countries get the vaccine fairly, does not have any deals with Russia, China or India yet, but China has said its three developers have applied to supply their vaccines to the programme and is waiting to see if they are approved.

As rich countries scramble to stockpile vaccines for their own citizens, the World Health Organization has urged them to think wider.

Since the start of the pandemic, WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has repeated his message that kindness and togetherness are key to beating COVID-19.

“To protect the world, we must ensure that all people at risk everywhere – not just in countries who can afford vaccines – are immunised,” Dr Tedros said in his New Year’s speech.

Public health experts around the world are urging people receiving their COVID-19 vaccine to think about those who may not have access to a vaccine by donating to COVAX.

Social media users have been echoing that message under the #MatchMyJab hashtag.

Here's how the COVAX scheme is distributing the first batch of coronavirus vaccines to low-income countries



The COVAX program aims to address the global imbalance of vaccine distribution. By the end of 2021, it wants to secure enough vaccines for at least the most vulnerable 20 per cent in 145 low- and middle-income countries.

To do this, it needs more than $US4 billion ($A5.23 billion) urgently, according to the WHO. G7 countries have agreed to share a portion of their vaccines to COVAX, as well as pledge significant amounts of new funding to the program.

But while governments and pharmaceutical groups are key to equitable vaccine rollout, the general public can also make a huge difference.

Clare Strachan, principal advisor at Nossal Institute for Global Health at the University of Melbourne, says people in wealthy countries experiencing an organised vaccine rollout “have to look outwardly and think about being fair”.

“As COVID continues to surge in low- and middle-income countries across the world, there has been a lot of money committed to COVAX, but there isn’t enough and we may need a lot of money for a long time to come to sustain the vaccination effort,"" Ms Strachan said.

""There are fears many low-income countries will not have enough stock to protect their key and vulnerable populations. COVID has heightened the gaps between the rich and the poor - it's on all of us to address those inequities.""Ms Strachan says she would love to see #MatchMyJab take off. 

""As we get our government-funded vaccines that have travelled to us over so many countries that have desperately needed them, it is important to think of the millions of people in low-income countries where the vaccine is still nowhere in sight."" 
Dr Diego Silva, lecturer in Bioethics at the University of Sydney School of Public Health, agrees we “have a moral obligation as global citizens to support and help our fellow humans"". 

For once, it would also show the world how much we care, he says.

“If every Australian chipped in two dollars for their vaccine, we’d have close to $A50 million. That would be terrific. It would show the world we think of people outside of Australia. While we are grappling with things like Manus Island and other immigration issues, it would be a very welcome change.”Helping them helps us
The first doses of COVID-19 vaccines shipped from the COVAX facility in late February to Ghana. The program has since sent more than 12 million vaccine doses to 19 countries, 17 of them in Africa.

Countries will receive doses in proportion to population size, with the most going to India (97.2 million), Pakistan (17.2 million), Nigeria (16 million), Indonesia (13.7 million), Bangladesh (12.8 million) and Brazil (10.6 million).

Other big recipients are Ethiopia (8.9 million), the Democratic Republic of Congo (6.9 million), Mexico (6.5 million), the Philippines (5.6 million) and Egypt (5.1 million).

This week, Gavi the Vaccine Alliance, which co-leads COVAX with the WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, implemented its first autonomous drones in order to deliver vaccines more quickly. In recent days, drones have dropped more than 2.5 million doses on Ghana.The whole world depends on the program’s success, say public health experts.

If COVAX doesn’t get vaccines out fast enough, the globe will remain in the grip of pandemic. 

“If COVAX don’t raise enough money, one possible outcome is the world becomes essentially divided into two parts - those countries that have vaccines, vaccine passports, travel and trade, and the countries who don’t,"" Dr Silva said.

“The other possible outcome is that we will take forever to get out of this pandemic as a world, so all of us will be dragged down.“So there’s a sense in which you’re only as strong as those in a worse position ... Unless we want to indefinitely close our borders for several years to come, it is in our interest to ensure that the virus is under control in every other country.”

Time is of the essence, Ms Strachan said.

""What we are hearing is that there is a sense in some African countries hard hit by the virus that they can’t afford to continue locking down – some people are not abiding by social distancing and other public health measures, which is spearheading the spread of the virus.""

Plus, any vaccine delay in low- and middle-income countries will only give the virus greater opportunity to mutate into highly transmissible variants, which could undermine the efficacy of vaccines everywhere.

Rich countries are stockpiling coronavirus vaccines and poor nations are lagging behind



“If we allow the virus to thrive unabated in some countries, it’s going to lead to a greater risk for all of us,"" Ms Strachan said. ""And this affects the world opening up, being able to trade, and people being able to travel.

“As we start to open up through our national vaccine rollouts, we have to remember that the version of ‘normal’ that we are aiming at really won’t be within our grasp until we can protect key and vulnerable groups across the whole world.”

But while individuals together can offer COVAX a huge boost through initiatives like #MatchMyJab, the responsibility in getting vaccines to low- and middle-income countries lies firmly with governments through funding and pharmaceutical companies in reducing the price of vaccines, Dr Silva says.
“#MatchMyJab is great but the way we are going to get out of the pandemic is for countries’ governments and NGOs such as the WHO to work together,"" he said.

""We can pitch in, that’s great, and it’s important to get the message across about our responsibilities. But responsibility still lies with government.”

People getting vaccinated for COVID-19 are being urged to #MatchMyJab in attempt to end vaccine inequality",
2022/0123,Article,https://scroll.in/article/992328/covid-19-vaccine-production-and-distribution-has-exposed-and-intensified-global-inequality,"The Covid-19 pandemic has been unusual in several ways: the disproportionate extent to which people in rich countries (particularly in Europe and North America) have been affected; the sheer scale of the policy response for containment; and the speed and urgency of the global response.

The active interest in controlling the pandemic in rich countries shaped individual national responses as well as global policy. There was a massive push for vaccine development, through large subsidies for research and development to drug companies, pre-orders of vaccines, and other support by the US, Russia, China, and European countries.

This led to the rapid development of multiple Covid-19 vaccine candidates and even more rapid regulatory approval to several of them. Typically, vaccines take several years to be developed and approved, partly because of extended clinical trials to check for all possible responses. But some Covid-19 vaccine candidates were given official approval in Russia and China even before the essential Phase III trials were completed. Even in the US and Europe, regulatory processes were accelerated, sweeping aside the usual demands for complete data and without checking for possible side effects.

Despite such proactive policy, the production and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines has exposed and intensified global inequality. Three features stand out: blatant vaccine grab by rich countries; protection of patent rights by governments in advanced countries, which prevents wider production of vaccines; and the use of vaccine distribution to promote both nationalism and diplomatic “soft power”.

The great vaccine grab
It seems obvious that a pandemic can be overcome only when it is overcome everywhere. The delayed vaccination of people across the world increases the possibility of virus mutation, reducing the ability to control the pandemic even in rich countries that have bagged vaccines. Prolonged fear of infection, because of inadequate vaccination, affects economic prospects, inhibiting and delaying global economic recovery. These risks are so great that rich countries would still benefit even if they decided to pay on their own for vaccinating all of the world’s population.

An “every-country-for-itself” approach is irrational and even counterproductive. Yet that is exactly what has happened.

When three major vaccine candidates (from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and AstraZeneca) were approved in the US and Europe, rich countries scrambled to lay claim to vaccine doses, confirming that wealthy countries and individuals would monopolise early doses of any effective vaccine. As a result, by late February 2021 Covid-19 vaccinations were heavily concentrated in the developed world.This need not have occurred. The Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility or COVAX led by the World Health Organisation, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and Gavi, was established precisely to prevent this outcome, to prevent hoarding by rich countries and ensure access for the world’s poor. COVAX aims to accelerate Covid-19 vaccine development, secure doses for all countries, and distribute those doses fairly, beginning with the highest-risk groups.

By early 2021, 190 countries, representing most of the world’s population, had joined. In February, the United States (which had been kept out by former president Donald Trump) also joined. Higher-income and middle-income countries will have access to the vaccines in the COVAX list and pay for their doses individually. The 92 lower-income member countries are to receive their doses free of charge.

The COVAX plan is to distribute vaccines in two phases. In the first phase, all participating countries would receive doses proportionate to their populations, beginning with enough doses to immunise the 3% of their population at highest risk, especially frontline workers in health and social care. Additional doses would then be delivered to cover 20% of each country’s population, beginning with others most in danger, such as the elderly and those with co-morbidities.

In the second phase, vaccines would be delivered to specific countries based on how quickly the virus is spreading; whether other pathogens (like measles) are also spreading; and how vulnerable the country’s health infrastructure is to being overwhelmed. Eventually, everyone would be covered.

A fair system
This is a fair system, given constraints on production. But the facility still remains underfunded, thus far raising only $4 billion of its modest target of $6.8 billion for 2021. Even worse, it has not been able to purchase the vaccines required for free distribution to poor countries as much as planned. This is because the COVAX facility allows member countries to make their own separate purchases directly from pharma companies. As a result, rich countries have competed to secure bilateral deals with pharmaceutical companies outside of COVAX.

Within a month of the regulatory approval being granted to the first three vaccines, advanced countries, accounting for only 14% of the world’s population, had placed orders for around 85% of the estimated entire production for 2021 (Ghosh 2020).

Much of this was in the form of pre-orders even before regulatory approval was granted. Thirteen of the 48 firms engaged in Covid-19 vaccine development had made advance sales by mid-November 2020, promising to deliver 7.5 billion doses of vaccines, mostly to advanced countries, even before emergency-use authorisation had been granted. In some cases, this happened even before the clinical trials necessary for regulatory approval had been completed (Acharya and Reddy 2021).

Forty-four bilateral deals between governments and pharmaceutical companies (dominated by rich countries) were signed last year, and at least 12 have already been signed this year. Canada has ordered vaccines that could provide for more than 10 times its population – and then sought to get vaccines from COVAX as well. The US has ordered vaccines equivalent to more than four times its population.

Rich countries are now stockpiling vaccines that they have grabbed but are unable to distribute. Firms preferred to sell in these bilateral deals because they could charge higher prices than offered by COVAX. They typically keep secret the basic elements of the deal, including the price at which the vaccines were being provided to these governments.

This vaccine grab by rich countries meant that most of the world would get safe and approved vaccines only in 2022, and in some cases not even until 2024. In mid-January 2021, the head of the WHO noted that while 39 million vaccine doses had already been administered in the rich countries, in one poor country only 25 doses (in total) had been given, and 170 poorest countries had received no vaccines at all.

“I need to be blunt: the world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure – and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world’s poorest countries,” he said. (UN News, January 2021).

Patent law
Insufficient production is an important reason for the poor and unequal distribution. Yet this scarcity is completely unnecessary and could be easily and rapidly remedied. The major factor limiting supply of approved vaccines is the persistence of patent rights that give pharmaceutical companies a monopoly on production, confining supplies to their own capacities and the few production licences they choose to issue to others.

Patents are usually seen as providing a necessary financial reward for invention/innovation, without which technological change would either not occur or be more limited. Big pharma (which has been the major lobby pushing for inclusion of intellectual property rights in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and in subsequent trade and economic partnership agreements) argues that developing new drugs requires such incentives because the costs are very high and drugs may not succeed even after years of effort.

Yet for Covid-19 vaccines, many big pharma companies received massive subsidies from governments that have mostly and in some cases completely covered research and development costs. In the US alone, the six major vaccine companies received over $12 billion in public subsidies for developing Covid-19 vaccines (MSF 2021).

Other rich country governments have provided similar subsidies. Private pharma companies also benefited from prior public research (Scientific American 2020) and reduced costs of clinical testing, because of more unpaid volunteers for trials. The “leader” vaccines may have already received what could be considered as reasonable returns on their own investment, and more. For example, while Pfizer did not receive direct subsidies from the US government, it received pre-orders for 100 million doses for $1.95 billion (Industry Week 2020). Moreover, it relied on technology from BioNTech, which had received $445 million from the German government for their research (Bloomberg 2020).

Pfizer claims costs of $3.1 billion to develop this vaccine (BBC 2020), while estimated sales in 2021 will be worth $15 billion (Quartz, 2020). Developing the Moderna vaccine cost $2.5 billion, apparently entirely funded by the US federal government (USA Today, 2020). The recently approved Johnson and Johnson vaccine benefited from US government subsidies and a pre-order of 100 million doses likely to cover costs (Johnson and Johnson 2020).

The case of the AstraZeneca vaccine is particularly instructive, also because it is seen as viable for developing country use. (Significant quantities of this vaccine are being produced by the Serum Institute of India under a collaboration agreement.) The vaccine was entirely developed by a publicly funded lab at Oxford University. The original distribution model was for an open-licence platform, designed to make the vaccine freely available for any manufacturer.

However, the Gates Foundation, which had clout because it had donated $750 million to Oxford for vaccine development, persuaded the university to change course completely and sign “an exclusive vaccine deal with AstraZeneca that gave the pharmaceutical giant sole rights and no guarantee of low prices” (Jay Hancock 2020).

Oxford and AstraZeneca promised not to make profits from sale of the vaccine, but the details were left vague. While Oxford will receive no royalties during the pandemic, it could subsequently gain from patents including those held by Vaccitech, a for-profit spinoff.

Differential prices
Meanwhile, AstraZeneca is charging differential prices for its vaccines sent to different countries, with some poorer countries paying higher rates. The European Union pays $3.50 per dose, while Bangladesh pays $4, and South Africa as much as $5.25 (Politico, 2021). (The more expensive vaccines are being provided by the Serum Institute of India.)

This variation in prices is not confined to the AstraZeneca shot. Because of competition for doses and opacity in contracts, the range of reported prices of vaccines is vast: from $2.19 to as much as $44 per dose, as of 1 March. (UNICEF, Covid Dashboard).

This restricted production creating unseemly vaccine grabs, overpriced and differentially priced doses determined by private suppliers, and inadequate provision for most of the world’s population, could all have been avoided if a proposal brought by India and South Africa to the World Trade Organisation in October 2020 had been accepted. The proposal was for a waiver of obligations to enforce patents and other intellectual property rights related to Covid-19 products (MSF, November 2020).

This would mean that WTO members could choose not to grant or enforce patents and other intellectual property related to all Covid-19 drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, and other technologies, including masks and ventilators, for the duration of the pandemic. They could also more easily collaborate in research and development, technology transfer, manufacturing, scaling up, and supplying Covid-19 tools.

Most developing countries have supported this, but advanced countries have repeatedly blocked it in the TRIPS council of the WTO (Prabhala et al 2020). This is surprising, because such suspension would also benefit populations in the advanced countries by making available more vaccines quickly. A larger supply would reduce costs of additional vaccines, making them cheaper for governments and taxpayers across the world.

The blocking of the proposal at the WTO is presumably because of the lobbying power of multinational pharma companies, which have thus far been successful in preventing the TRIPS council from approving this on five separate attempts. (Incidentally, Bill Gates has refused to back this proposal (Mail & Guardian 2021).

The map below indicates how responses to this proposal in the WTO have closely tracked the persistent divide between global North and South. Rich countries that are home to the major multinational pharma companies have blocked it. These countries have already secured more than their requirements of Covid-19 vaccines. (It is a different matter that most of them have been less successful in distributing them quickly within their own countries, so they are now stockpiling vaccines.)Some have argued that this proposal is not necessary, since the WTO agreement on TRIPS already allows for compulsory licensing. The 2001 Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health explicitly mentions public health emergencies as adequate cause to issue compulsory licences. A compulsory licence is an authorisation granted by a government to a third party to produce a patented product or process, without the express consent of the patentee (See WTO FAQs). It allows a government to override the patentee’s exclusive right to keep others from using its patented inventions.

The idea is to prevent monopolistic behaviour, like preventing others from producing and charging excessively high prices. Conditions for compulsory licencing are obviously met in this pandemic, which is clearly a public health emergency. Some countries, like Chile and Israel, have already passed resolutions for such licences to be issued in the wake of the pandemic.

However, the difficulty with issuing compulsory licences in individual developing countries is that the transfer of technology by the inventor to other licenced producers is not compulsory. For pharmaceuticals, if the chemical composition of the product is known, the product can be reverse engineered and produced by other companies. When the precise technology for producing the vaccine is not known, compulsory licencing works only when patent holders are willing to make available the technology to licenced producers.

In the case of Covid-19 vaccines, the big pharma companies are happy to supply rich countries that are already competing for privileged access to the limited vaccine supply, and therefore are not really concerned about access to smaller or less well-endowed markets. A global waiver would change those incentives for companies.

Voluntary pooling
Therefore, a global move for suspension and/or modification of intellectual property rights for matters relating to essential public health concerns is essential. Since there is as yet no information on the immunity period offered by most of the vaccines, the suspension might be required for a more extended period. Such exemptions would be required not just for vaccines but for other treatments, tests, and products related to the pandemic, which may be required for the next few years.

Another idea is that of “voluntary pooling”, proposed by Costa Rica and supported by the WHO, which has created the Covid-19 Technology Access Pool (CTAP). This creates a pool of rights to tests, medicines and vaccines, with free access or licensing on reasonable and affordable terms for all countries. But so far only 40 (developing) countries have joined, and the major players have kept away. Lack of international support has meant that CTAP is not really effective thus far – but it may become significant in future, extending beyond the current Covid-19 pandemic to health emergencies in the future.

Other vaccine candidates being developed elsewhere also have the potential to combat the pandemic and ease the current shortages. The Sputnik V vaccine developed in Russia and the Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines developed in China are reportedly effective. There are other vaccines being developed in India, Cuba, and elsewhere. Some have concerns about inadequate testing and hasty regulatory approval without the required trials and other processes. But even when these vaccine candidates are found to be safe and effective through clinical trials, there are further hurdles to their being accepted internationally.

This is largely because the WHO’s approval process is heavily skewed in favour of vaccines developed in the rich countries. The WHO has a list of “stringent regulatory authorities” it trusts for quality control, which are only from developed countries in Europe, the US, Canada, Australia, and Japan. For the rest of the world, vaccine (and other drug) candidates are required to go through “prequalification” – a much more complicated and extended process. This greatly prolongs the time taken before vaccines from other countries are approved.

For example, the WHO approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at the end of 2020, less than two months after application, because WHO collaborates with the European Medicines Agency. However, the Russian (Sputnik) and Chinese (Sinovac and Sinopharm) vaccines, which had applied for approval even before the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, have still not received the WHO approval (Prabhala and Ling, 2021). All three of these companies can each produce up to 1 billion doses of vaccine in 2021 and have licensed production to other producers in developing countries.

In this pandemic, the usual regulatory standards have been greatly relaxed across the world, including in developed countries. No Covid-19 vaccine has been developed or released as transparently as it should have been. Even if WHO feels the regulatory standards in other countries might be less stringent, it could still work with different national regulatory authorities to ensure that all vaccine candidates are treated on an equal footing. Given the global scarcity that is denying people in poor countries access to vaccines, the WHO should take a proactive approach to enable global distribution of such vaccines when they meet some harmonised standards.

If this is done, it may be possible to circumvent the stranglehold of the big pharma companies on Covid-19 vaccines, which enables private profiteering in the midst of a health crisis and widespread economic distress. Some countries have already approved these other vaccine candidates for domestic use and have benefited from this access.

For example, by late February 2021 Chile had managed to provided vaccine doses to 17% of its population, by relying on imports of the China’s Sinovac, which is also being used in Bolivia, Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey. Several countries have approved the Sinopharm vaccine, including UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Serbia, Morocco, Hungary, and Pakistan. The Sputnik V vaccine is likely to be produced and distributed in several countries across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America.

Indian example
India should have been a prime example of successful production and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. It has a number of major vaccine companies, has a long and successful history of inoculation drives, and until recently, there was a high degree of public trust in vaccines. Unfortunately, over-enthusiastic attempts by the government to first promote and then push particular vaccine candidates (Covaxin produced by Bharat Biotech) even before the required clinical trials were completed may have proved to be counterproductive, reducing public trust within and outside India. There have been many reports of people in India – including health workers – refusing to be vaccinated with Covaxin.

This is unfortunate, since once such trust has been lost, it takes time to be remedied and reversed. It also has an impact on India’s ability to export vaccines now and in the future. A recent YouGov poll of 19,000 people in 17 developed countries found that vaccines developed in Russia, China, and India ranked lowest in popular perceptions of efficacy, just above Iran which has very little vaccine production (Prabhala and Ling, 2021). India has also been plagued by major issues in distribution, belying expectations and past experience of vaccination drives.

To be fair, most countries have shown poor performance in vaccine rollout, including the developed countries that have sought to grab many multiples of their required shares of global supply. Overall, domestic distribution of vaccines has mostly mirrored the global distribution: unequal, unjust, and incompetent. This approach will delay the resolution of the ongoing pandemic and creates concerns about humanity’s ability to co-operate to address with the even greater challenges ahead.

As India gears up to renew its vaccine exports, called Vaccine Maitri, here’s everything you need to know about the scheme and why it was cancelled.

Beginning of Vaccine Maitri

In January 2021, India launched the Vaccine Maitri (Vaccine Friendship) initiative – a major diplomatic effort to gift and supply made-in-India vaccines to low-income and developing countries globally.

Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, Mauritius, Sri Lanka, Brazil, Morocco, South Africa, Afghanistan, Mexico, DR Congo, Nigeria and the United Kingdom were among some of the beneficiaries of the Vaccine Maitri initiative.As of 29 May, data from the Ministry of External Affairs showed that India had exported 6.63 crore doses to other countries of which 10.7 crore went as a grant, whereas 35.7 crore doses were given in a commercial capacity.

With 10.3 crore doses, Bangladesh received the most COVID-19 doses under the Vaccine Maitri programme.

India kicked off international shipment of the vaccines on 20 January 2021, only four days after starting its own vaccination program. Bhutan and Maldives were the first countries to receive vaccines as a grant by India.

India’s vaccine diplomacy served as an effective tool and instrument of Indian soft-power and influence, serving to cement and deepen ties in India’s neighbourhood and Indo-Pacific.

Many believed at the time that India’s vaccine diplomacy could translate into critical votes at a time when India has secured a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council and is scheduled to host the G20 summit in 2023. The goodwill India earns through its vaccine diplomacy could pay dividends in the future.

Vaccine Maitri comes to a halt

However, India’s export of coronavirus vaccines came to a halt in in April, with India facing a severe shortage for its immunisation programme amid a surging second wave.

Pavan K Varma, former Janata Dal (United) leader and a former diplomat in a column in the Times of India wrote that Vaccine Maitri was based on ""an erroneous impression that India had ‘conquered’ the virus, and was thus in a position to be magnanimous to the needs of others because its own had been met"".

Questioning the policy, he further wrote, ""It was a noble gesture, but it missed out that in this bathos of international goodwill, India had inoculated less than 10 percent of its own people. The vicious velocity of the second wave caught our benevolence completely off guard. The unseemly polarity between the ‘pharmacy of the world’ gifting vaccines, and its own citizens running from pillar to post to get vaccinated, was stark.""

Former diplomat KC Singh too tweeted several times that the country was indulging in ""vaccine diplomacy"" amid initial concerns that the number of doses exported was more than those administered domestically.

Amid the criticism from the Opposition over the exports of COVID-19 vaccines, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in April had hit back saying those who questioned the policy were “short-sighted” and also “irresponsible and non-serious” people.

The minister said India cannot just expect raw materials, for the vaccine, from other countries and then not send them the final product.

""I would say the blame-game wallahs will have their attitude and their approach. As serious people, let’s look at it. Today, as foreign minister, I am pushing other countries, particularly some big countries, saying look please keep the raw materials flowing for vaccines to be made in India. Can I, on one hand, go around the world and tell people ‘guys keep your supply chains flowing towards me and I am asking you for raw material but I’m not going to give you the vaccine’?” he said, lambasting the Vaccine Maitri critics.

Restarting exports

On 20 September, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya had announced that India's vaccine diplomacy would restart in October.The decision came just before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Washington visit, where COVID-19 vaccines were discussed at length during the QUAD summit.

Following Mandaviya's announcement, the exports began in October and it was reported that India has already given 10 lakh vaccine doses each to four countries - Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Iran.

Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India, which manufacture Covaxin and Covishield respectively, have stepped up their processes, providing the country with 280 million doses in October.

Owing to the increase in production, the government has decided to export the surplus to other nations.

A recent PTI report also said that the Centre had permitted the export of five crore doses of Covovax, Serum Institute's COVID-19 vaccine, to Indonesia.

Despite exports beginning, the programme won’t gain significant momentum until next year. In October, Serum Institute's CEO Adar Poonawalla had suggested that large volumes would be going to COVAX — the international vaccine-sharing initiative backed by the World Health Organisation — by January 2022.

Similarly, VK Paul, who heads the Indian government’s COVID-19 task force, also placed greater expectations on 2022, saying that “a huge, huge availability of vaccines can be visualised for next year” rather than in 2021.

2022/0126,Article,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/how-covid-19-vaccines-can-shape-china-and-indias-global-influence.html,"SINGAPORE – With mass vaccination campaigns against Covid-19 underway globally, there is an emerging gap between rich and poor nations in their abilities to secure enough shots to immunize their people.

Wealthy nations have been accused of hoarding vaccines, mostly from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. That has created room for India, China, and to an extent Russia, to develop, produce and supply vaccines to the developing world. Experts say those efforts can potentially bolster those countries’ influence and deepen their ties with other nations.

“While it serves their foreign policy objectives, it serves their ... commercial interest to expand the market share of their vaccine products,” Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNBC by phone.

“In the meantime, it also helps mitigate the vast disparities in terms of the vaccine access between the wealthy nations and the poor nations,” he added.World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week that drugmakers prioritized regulatory approval in rich countries where the profits are highest, rather than submitting full dossiers to expedite a global vaccine distribution initiative supported by the WHO.

“The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure – and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world’s poorest countries,” Tedros said.

‘Political goodwill and influence’
India has already sent 1 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to Nepal, 2 million to Bangladesh, 150,000 to Bhutan, 100,000 to Maldives and 1.5 million to Myanmar, per media reports. It has also sent 2 million doses to Brazil.

India approved two vaccines for emergency use – one developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, which is being produced locally by the Serum Institute of India, and the other, named Covaxin, was developed domestically.

Vaccine diplomacy can be an effective use of soft power that can help New Delhi win friends and generate goodwill, according to Akhil Bery, South Asia analyst at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group.“India’s generosity with its neighbors can help to mend ties, whether it be with Bangladesh (which was strained due to the Citizenship Amendment Act), or with Sri Lanka, where the Rajapaksas are known to have a pro-China tilt,” Bery told CNBC by email. The Rajapaksas are a prominent political family in Sri Lanka – both the country’s president and prime minister are part of the family.

“Even if the doses aren’t that many, it’s still significant enough to alleviate pressure on healthcare systems, allowing for resources to be allocated elsewhere,” Bery added.

With the virus mostly under control at home, China’s strategy includes striking deals with emerging economies to conduct clinical trials for a vaccine developed by Chinese firm Sinovac and helping to build vaccine production facilities in some of those countries. Beijing is also giving priority access to its vaccines in places like Southeast Asia, which is of strategic importance to China. In other places, the country is offering loans to fund vaccine procurement.

Eurasia Group’s China researcher, Allison Sherlock, told CNBC that the benefits for China are limited to reinforcing economic and political ties in its existing sphere of influence in regions including Southeast Asia. There, Beijing “is especially hoping that the vaccine will help repair relationships strained by tensions over the South China Sea, including with Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.”

“India wants to burnish its credentials as a responsible global stakeholder while China would like to improve its reputation which got tarnished in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Harsh Pant, head of the strategic studies program at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi.India, which kicked off its domestic immunization campaign this month, is not producing or using Covid vaccines as a kind of diplomacy, former Indian ambassador Rajiv Bhatia told CNBC. “It is very much first a national effort,” he said.

“Vaccines are primarily to help the country’s people but India has not forgotten its global responsibility,” Bhatia said. He explained that India’s efforts would help enhance the international prestige of the country’s scientists and products. The shots “will have positive impact beyond insulating people from this disease. It will add to the national pride and confidence.”

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Monday responded to questions about India’s plans to send vaccines to its neighbors and said, “This issue can afford no place for malign competition, let alone the so-called ‘rivalry’. We hope and welcome that more doses of safe and effective vaccines will be manufactured at a faster pace by more countries.”

Beijing has stepped up domestic efforts to immunize key groups of people ahead of the Lunar New Year next month, when many are expected to travel around the country. Reuters reported that China approved three vaccines for emergency use but only one for the general public, while a fourth is being used by the military.

“Both would be hoping that their outreach would give them some political goodwill and influence as well,” he told CNBC by email.

The coronavirus was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in 2019 and Beijing has faced criticism over its early handling of the pandemic.

Domestic considerations
Given the nature of Sino-Indian ties, experts said it was inevitable that New Delhi and Beijing’s efforts in providing vaccines to other countries would be viewed through a competitive lens. Both India and China have downplayed the notion of vaccine diplomacy, describing the jabs as a necessary public good to tackle the global pandemic.CFR’s Huang said he sensed a shift in China’s strategy in which Beijing is starting to prioritize domestic needs more, but is still following through on promises. He explained that China is likely to rely more on countries that have signed partnership agreements to produce its vaccines and use that to support other nations. China may also “provide financial assistance so that (other countries) can buy the vaccines from other sources,” Huang added.

Challenges
One of the challenges vaccines developed locally in India and China face is their effectiveness in combating the disease.

India’s Covaxin is still undergoing clinical trials. At the time it received emergency approval from the drug regulator, it did not have extensive phase three trial data to determine its efficacy or safety. The rushed move was criticized by scientists.

Sinovac’s CoronaVac was found to be only 50.4% effective in clinical trials carried out in Brazil but has yielded different results elsewhere, raising concern and criticism over data transparency.

“An argument can be made if you have a vaccine whose efficacy rate is as low as 50%, you need more people to get vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity,” CFR’s Huang said.

He added that India and China, both of which have large populations, will have to grapple with fulfilling domestic needs while maintaining international obligations and demand.

“That is going to further complicate issue in their efforts to play a leadership role by reducing the vaccine access gap,” he said.

Eurasia Group’s Bery said that one advantage India has is that the Serum Institute is one of the world’s largest vaccine manufacturers and that the country supplies more than 50% of the world’s vaccines.

“It will take time, but as we’ve seen from South Africa and Brazil, countries are lining up to gain access to vaccines manufactured in India,” he said.

Bery explained, however, China has its own distinct advantage – unlike its South Asian rival, it has brought the pandemic under control much quicker, thus the Chinese economy has recovered faster.

“This allowed it to increase international policy actions, while other countries, such as India, remained distracted by the pandemic,” Bery said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106825762-1610931755395-GettyImages-1230633280.jpg?v=1617867033&w=740&h=416,Jan 28 2021,CNBC,"How Covid-19 vaccines can shape China and India’s global influence

2022/0127,Article,https://www.hudson.org/research/16655-india-s-covid-diplomacy-trying-to-wean-neighbors-off-china,"India seems to have initiated ‘vaccine diplomacy’ to win over some of its neighbors already indebted to China. New Delhi may not have the large capital reserves that Beijing has used to lend heavily for wasteful infrastructure projects in South Asia. But India is the Pharmacy of the world, in addition to being the world’s largest democracy. India plans to obstruct China’s plan to take the lead in offering cheaper vaccines of the novel Coronavirus, which had originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

Most countries are worried about first vaccinating their own people, and India is no different. But India’s huge pharmaceutical capacity also enables India to offer millions of doses of the relatively cheaper vaccine to its neighbors.

As of now, this includes 1 million doses for Nepal, 2 million for Bangladesh, 150,000 to Bhutan, and 100,000 to Maldives. All these countries littoral to the Indian Ocean have been targeted by China for inclusion in its sphere of influence. Moreover, 1.5 million doses of India’s COVID vaccine are being sent to Myanmar, 50,000 to the island nation of Seychelles and 150,000 to Mauritius.

When India’s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar declared that India “will deliver to overcome the COVID challenge,()”:https://abcnews.go.com/US/pharmacy-world-deliver-india-begins-covid-19-vaccine/story?id=75367743 it was clear that combatting COVID in the Indo-Pacific region is as much part of India’s foreign policy as it is a humanitarian gesture. India has also offered to train local health care workers and help build the infrastructure to vaccinate the populace in addition to supplying vaccines.

But Indian activism in the developmental arena and humanitarian diplomacy has not diminished its reluctance to project hard power. India hesitates to acquire or deploy military assets beyond its shores and expects to win hearts and minds by helping others.

India remains eager to be the first responder to humanitarian crises in the region, as it did in reaction to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and now the Coronavirus pandemic.

When COVID-19 struck, New Delhi was quick to act and pushed for a regional response to the pandemic coordinated by SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation). India set up a SAARC COVID-19 fund and contributed $10 million to it. India also sent personal protective equipment and medical teams to Nepal and the Maldives to set up quarantine facilities and train their personnel in quarantining and COVID testing.

India also supplied the drug hydroxychloroquine to its neighbors and to friends and partners, including the United States and Brazil. It also acted in concert with other nations, both bilaterally and through the W.H.O. The Indian Navy kept two ships on standby for immediate deployment to any foreign country to evacuate Indian personnel or deliver emergency provisions.

As the world’s largest manufacturer of generic drugs, the country has long viewed itself as the pharmaceutical hub for the developing world. The world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, Serum Institute of India, has been licensed by AstraZeneca to manufacture 60 percent of the global supply of AstraZeneca’s COVID vaccine.

In addition to providing doses of vaccines as gifts to immediate neighbors, India is also ensuring its friends around the world have access to the vaccine. Brazil, a close Indian partner, has purchased 2 million doses, while Morocco has bought another 2 million. Saudi Arabia and South Africa also have purchased vaccines from the Serum Institute of India.

India’s distribution of the vaccine in South Asia, is a function of its strategic priorities. As the regional hegemon, India is concerned over China’s deepening economic and security ties with many of India’s immediate neighbors.

Although India has so far been unable to compete with China’s multi-billion-dollar loans under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), it appears to be doing better in its healthcare diplomacy. Nepal’s Minister of Health and Population recently acknowledged India’s goodwill in “providing the vaccine in grant.”

Notwithstanding its bonhomie with Beijing, Nepal has not yet granted approval to the Chinese vaccine, Sinopharm. Bangladesh, which was originally supposed to get 110,00 doses of the Chinese vaccine, also refused China’s offer after being told that it would have to contribute to the cost of the vaccine.

China’s overreach and India’s outreach are helping contain China’s sway over South Asia’s elites.

Soon after the pandemic erupted, China offered to send personal protective equipment (PPE) to countries around the world. Except for Pakistan, all other South Asian countries complained about faulty Chinese equipment, contrasting it with the safe equipment, medicines, and training provided by the Indians.

India knows that it might not be able to reduce China’s deep economic and security ties with Pakistan. But its efforts to win back Sri Lanka, and maintain Indian influence in the Maldives, Nepal, and Bangladesh continue. ‘Vaccine diplomacy’ is India’s latest move on the region’s political chessboard.",https://www.hudson.org/content/researches/thumb/16655/feature_getty_images_1230706280.jpg,"January 28, 2021",Hudson Institute,India's COVID Diplomacy: Trying to Wean Neighbors off China?,
2022/0128,Article,https://theprobe.in/china-gains-from-indias-covid-19-setbacks/,"Besides the deathly blow to its economy and reputation as the country that had successfully fought off a pandemic that had roiled far more established and affluent societies, the second wave of the deathly Coronavirus poses far serious foreign policy challenges to India than it is understood by those experts that revel in the misplaced triumphalism of our national leadership. Contrary to their loud proclamations, India is looking like a loser in this regional stand-off.

In the space of a month, our decrepit public health infrastructure and poverty has exposed the limitations of an assertive foreign policy that we have been pursuing in the neighbourhood and elsewhere to present ourselves as a worthy counterpoint to a belligerent China. This setback after the sudden explosion of Coronavirus cases comes at a critical time when China has infiltrated into Northern Ladakh and occupied around 1500 kilometers. Though it retreated from some features after the US got a new President but they have hung on to prominent intrusion points like Hot Spring, Depsang and Gogra. Bizarrely, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, usually garrulous when it comes to attacking his domestic opponents, has been painfully silent on the Chinese invasion.

Modi who had met the Chinese leader 18 times in the past few years, decided to field his officials to negotiate with the Chinese military leadership rather than making the phone call to President Xi Jinping. Perhaps he held back that card for later use.

In the absence of a real rapprochement, China is aggressively sucking up all the influence that India had garnered in its neighborhood ever since it made it clear to them that relationship is a zero sum game – you cannot be friends with India and China at the same time.

The real test of this new paradigm was visible in India’s ‘vaccine maitri’ policy where New Delhi promised to take care of its neighbour’s vaccine needs to fight the Coronavirus. In fact, Bangladesh had been far gone in its negotiations with China, which was giving public health guarantees by creating an infrastructure and free vaccines for its population. Then India stepped in and convinced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to opt for AstraZeneca’s Covishield, manufactured by Serum Institute at Pune, India.

As a gesture of friendship India gave 3 million vaccines free to Dhaka and more were to be bought by them at commercial rates. Since the last week of April, there has been no supply from the Serum Institute as India needed vaccines for itself after an explosive surge that killed hundreds of thousands of people. Bangladesh has put on hold its vaccination drive. Though there has been no word from SII whether it will meet its commitment, it is assumed in Dhaka that there will be no supplies from India.
This does not mean that the government of Bangladesh is not desperate to inoculate its citizens. In fact they are also grappling with the issue of what to do with those who got the first jab of Covishield? Can they use other vaccines for the second jab – for instance the Chinese vaccines that’s being pushed hard to replace Covishield?

Reports from Dhaka suggest that China is offering to fill the gap of Indian vaccines. Some reports from Bangladesh claim that China is willing to make good its earlier promise to give the country a public health guarantee that includes free vaccinations for the rest of the country if it abandons New Delhi and stands along with it in its opposition to Quad.
Quite apparently, Chinese opposition to Quad and its fear of militarization were not just behind the intrusion into Northern Ladakh, but is also driving Beijing to use the Coronavirus crisis and the desperation for vaccine amongst India’s neighbours to dismantle New Delhi’s influence and the clout it would have brought to the four nation compact.

Not just in Bangladesh, which is the most populous and important from the standpoint of China’s much vaunted Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), other countries in the neighbourhood like Nepal and Sri Lanka, too, have been badly hit by India’s calamity.

Landlocked Nepal, which depends on India for many things, is the worst affected. Here, too, India gave free vaccines, but, now it is again not able to fulfill its commitment. Worse, Nepal does not have a public health system worth the name – quite like many parts of India – and was banking on New Delhi to provide early vaccination and support in the event of a surge. However, it had not expected this kind of surge from Indian variant to pommel its unsuspecting population. Suffering in India and the spike in demand for vaccines has ensured that Nepal looks for help elsewhere. It has called out to the US and EU, but that’s unlikely to happen. As a senior diplomat concurred with this writer that eventually the Nepalese will have to be bailed out by its other neighbour – China.
Though China meddles routinely in Nepal, it has held its hand when it comes to fighting off India’s larger cultural and religious influences. With India baulking from meeting its vaccine commitments, Kathmandu will have to lean on Beijing to save its population. What is not known, though, is whether this help from its northern neighbour would tilt Nepal more towards China and end its inordinate reliance on India?

Even before the latest surge, there has been considerable speculation about the growing drift of Nepal towards China. Bringing its train right up to Kathmandu was to be the starting point to grow its influence in this region, but after facing push back from India and the US, China has displayed some ambivalence. Now the second surge of the virus and the increasing reliance of the countries on its vaccine, provides China another opportunity.

Sri Lanka, too, has been left high and dry due to the unfolding Indian tragedy. Though there is plenty of sympathy, the imperative of early vaccination is driving the Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to knock on the doors of China for help.
There has not been much in the media about how many vaccine jabs Sri Lanka needs, but it is a matter of time before Chinese vaccines find their way here too!

It is in Africa that India will be losing its growing influence. Here again, as part of WHO sponsored COVAX initiative, India was to manufacture vaccines and send it here, but the catastrophe that engulfed India has forced it to back off from its commitment.
Again SII was to send the vaccines, but it just cannot. Reports suggest that China again is benefiting from its vaccine diplomacy, which India was trying to master.

In just a month, India’s inability to priortise beefing up its public health infrastructure has tripped it from claiming itself as a regional power. Other countries like Sri Lanka or even Bangladesh that invested in human resources seem to have handled the surge better allowing them, in the process, strategic autonomy to rise above its geographical limitations. In this unfolding tragedy – India has emerged as a loser allowing its bête noire to fulfill its regional ambitions.",https://www.hudson.org/content/researches/thumb/16655/feature_getty_images_1230706280.jpg,5/8/2021,The probe,,
2022/0129,Article,https://www.indiachinainstitute.org/2021/03/04/indias_vaccine_diplomacy/,"Against the trend of vaccine nationalism, India is emerging as one of the major global suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines, writes Dr Biswajit Dhar, professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University. This article was originally published in Pandemic Discourses. 

For over two decades, India has acquired the reputation of being the “pharmacy of the world” as its strong generic pharmaceutical industry has been supplying affordable medicines conforming to quality standards to the global markets [1]. This reputation grew out of the critical interventions that the Indian companies had made during the HIV/AIDS pandemic, by supplying affordable antiretroviral medicines to African countries, when the major pharmaceutical producers had demanded excessively high prices for these medicines [2]. Subsequently, after the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria became a reality as a multi-stakeholder initiative to reduce the burden of these diseases, India’s generic industry emerged as one of the largest suppliers. Also significant is that fact that exports of medicines from India, which were around a billion dollars at the turn of the century, are currently well over $20 billion.

The objective is to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines, medicines and other medical products are freed from the encumbrances of these IPRs, thus making them affordable. The twin initiatives underline a key message for the global community: in pandemic times, medical products must be treated as global public goods.

In keeping with its historical role as a provider of affordable medicines, India has taken two significant initiatives to overcome the scourge of the COVID-pandemic. The first is to make vaccines widely available, which is in response to the growing evidence of the criticality of making COVID-19 vaccines accessible to all. The second initiative is a joint proposal tabled along with South Africa in the World Trade Organization (WTO), which seeks temporary waiver from the implementation and enforcement of four forms of intellectual property rights (IPRs). The objective is to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines, medicines and other medical products are freed from the encumbrances of these IPRs, thus making them affordable. The twin initiatives underline a key message for the global community: in pandemic times, medical products must be treated as global public goods.

Over the past month, India has now emerged as one of the major suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines. The country is able to play this role given its partnership with the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by number of doses (the company claims it can produce 1.5 billion doses annually). In June 2020, SII entered into a licensing agreement with AstraZeneca [3], a British-Swedish pharmaceutical company, to supply one billion doses of the Oxford University COVID-19 vaccine to middle and low income countries, including India. SII is currently supplying its vaccine, “Covishield”, to the Government of India. Prior to this tie-up, another India biopharmaceutical company, Bharat Biotech International Ltd together with the Indian Council of Medical Research, the government agency promoting biomedical research, began their collaboration developing a COVID-19 vaccine, “Covaxin”.

Even as it was organizing its COVID-vaccine roll-out, the Indian government announced an elaborate “vaccine diplomacy” strategy for providing vaccines to most of its neighbors, and a sizeable number of other developing countries, including those from Africa. India’s seven neighbors in South Asia: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Other countries that have already received “vaccine assistance” are Seychelles, Myanmar and Mauritius. In the South Asian region in which China’s growing presence has been clearly discernible over the past few years, the Government of India’s “vaccine diplomacy” could help in making the playing field more even.

India has decided to supply 10 million doses of the vaccine to Africa and 1 million to UN health workers India under the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI). Among the individual countries, Bangladesh is the largest beneficiary having received 7 million doses of “Covishield” vaccine, of which 2 million doses are in the form of grant, while Nepal has received 1 million. Bhutan and Maldives have received 150,000 doses and 100,000 doses respectively, while Sri Lanka and Afghanistan have both received 500,000 doses. Other than its South Asian neighbors, Government of India has supplied 1.5 million doses of “Covaxin” vaccine to Myanmar. Mauritius and Seychelles have been sent 100,000 doses and 50,000 doses of “Covishield,” respectively. Several other countries, including Bahrain, Barbados, Dominica, Oman, are also part of India’s “vaccine assistance” program. Thus, India is using its soft power to assist developing countries, a role that it has increasingly been playing as a development partner.

Vaccine supplies to the aforementioned countries should be seen as a part of the development partnership initiative that the Government of India has been pursuing since the early 1950s. This initiative was formalized in 2012 with the establishment of the “Development Partnership Administration”, which, while extending support to other developing countries, recognizes that the “most fundamental principle in cooperation is respecting development partners and be guided by their development priorities”[4]. Essentially, India’s development partnership is geared towards meeting the identified needs of the partner countries as is technically and financially feasible [5]. In other words, India has been pursuing a “demand driven” development cooperation program and is, therefore, better suited to meet the requirements of the recipients.

Another important aspect of India as a supplier of COVID-19 vaccines is that the government allowed vaccine exports on commercial terms, mostly to upper middle income countries seeking them, even when an embargo was imposed on commercial sales of vaccines in India. Morocco, Brazil and South Africa are among the countries that would benefit from this policy stance. Morocco is the largest importer of vaccines from India (6 million doses), while Brazil and South Africa have imported 2 million doses import 1 million doses of “Covishield” respectively. Details are provided in the Annex table.

The real value of India’s “vaccine diplomacy” was seen when Canadian Prime Minister, Trudeau, sought Prime Minister Modi’s assistance for vaccine supplies from SII. Over the past few months, relations between the two countries had soured, and therefore India’s “vaccine diplomacy” helped bring normalcy. Although Canada had firmed up deals with seven vaccine suppliers, timely supplies have severely impacted its vaccine roll-out plans. Supplies from SII will help Canada make up for the shortfall in its vaccine supplies.

The Indian government’s vaccine sharing policy with partner countries is without doubt a standout in times of the alarming precedent of “vaccine nationalism” practiced by several countries, instead of recognizing vaccines as global public good. According to Duke University’s Global Health Institute, a group of advanced countries, accounting for only 16 percent of the world’s population, have secured for themselves 60 percent of the global vaccine supplies.

The Indian government’s vaccine sharing policy with partner countries is without doubt a standout in times of the alarming precedent of “vaccine nationalism” practiced by several countries, instead of recognizing vaccines as global public good. According to Duke University’s Global Health Institute, a group of advanced countries, accounting for only 16 percent of the world’s population, have secured for themselves 60 percent of the global vaccine supplies. Canada heads the list of “vaccine nationalists,” having assured vaccine supplies that is nine times its population, while the United Kingdom has stocked enough doses to vaccinate every citizen six times. Other countries to secure vaccine supplies that are well beyond their domestic requirements are Australia, Chile, the United States, and members of the European Union. On the other hand, India is sharing its available vaccine supplies with several countries, and also ensuring that the domestic demand is met.

Not surprisingly, global supplies have been seriously affected at a juncture when every country is trying to overcome the pandemic-induced crisis. Several studies have cautioned that inadequate availability of vaccines, especially for smaller countries, would prolong their recovery thus triggering significant increases in global inequalities. A Rand Corporation study has concluded that if low and low-middle income countries (LLMICs) are not able to adequately immunize their populations, high income countries (HICs) would be severely impacted. According to the study, total cumulative economic cost for 30 HICs could increase from $82 billion in 2020–2021 to $258 billion in 2023–2024. The United States could incur the highest relative cost, $15.7 billion in 2020–2021, rising to $49.3 billion in 2023–2024, while the corresponding figures for Germany were estimated to be $9.9 billion and $31.1 billion respectively.

A recent study commissioned by the International Chamber of Commerce has observed that that equitable distribution of vaccines is in the economic interest of every country, especially those that mostly depend on trade. The study elaborates a significant point that the President of the European Commission Dr. Ursula von der Leyen had made during the height of the pandemic last year, “None of us will be safe until everyone is safe”. The study concludes that assuming that all HICs fully vaccinate their populations by the middle of 2021 and poorer countries find themselves largely excluded, the global economy could lose upward of $9 trillion, which is larger than the combined GDP of Japan and Germany. But if 50 percent of the developing country citizens get vaccinated by the end of 2021, the study concludes that the global economy would lose up to $4.4 trillion. Clearly, the costs of non-cooperation in responding to the vaccine requirements of developing countries could be substantial [6].

Thus, central to the possibility of an early recovery of the global economy from the COVID-19 induced crisis is affordable access to vaccines and medicines, especially for the citizens of the developing countries.

Thus, central to the possibility of an early recovery of the global economy from the COVID-19 induced crisis is affordable access to vaccines and medicines, especially for the citizens of the developing countries. Towards this end, India and South Africa had taken an important initiative in October 2020 in the WTO through their proposal to ensure accessibility and affordability of COVID-19 vaccines, medicines, and related products [7]. The proposal, which has now been co-sponsored by 55 other members of the Organization and has also been supported by Holy See [8], argues in favor of granting temporary waiver from the WTO members’ commitments to implement or apply four forms of intellectual property rights [9] so that these critical products and their technologies are widely available for “containment or treatment of COVID-19” [10]. At the height of the last major pandemic, namely, HIV/AIDS, WTO members had adopted the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, which introduced flexibilities in the implementation of the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), recognizing that the “TRIPS Agreement does not and should not prevent Members from taking measures to protect public health”. They also affirmed that the TRIPS Agreement “can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO Members’ right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all” [11]. This spirit needs to be rekindled for overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic.",,"March 4th, 2021",India China Institute,India’s Vaccine Diplomacy,
2022/0130,Article,https://www.newslaundry.com/2021/01/25/india-has-got-its-vaccine-diplomacy-right,"As the vagaries of international politics unfolded amidst the global pandemic, the last nine months have been remarkable for one consistency in India’s diplomatic response to the crisis. The current impetus to vaccine diplomacy is in line with Indian foreign policy’s initial recognition of the diplomatic window presented by the situation.

In March 2020, New Delhi began to make moves by seeking a prime mover role in reaching out to its neighbours in South Asia through regional platforms like the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. While hosting a video conference with leaders of SAARC countries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposed a slew of measures, including the setting up of a Covid emergency fund with an initial contribution of $10 million from India, putting together a rapid response team of doctors and specialists, and setting up an information system for disease surveillance.

As the world now moves to the alleviatory phase of inoculation against the disease, India’s efforts at using its technical advantage in large-scale vaccine production to enhance its diplomatic leverage is gathering momentum. The last two weeks have seen India pushing this new driver of bilateral engagement with a number of neighbours as well as other countries of the developing world.

The obvious enabler of the current push is India’s status as a pivotal vaccine supplier as the country meets 62 percent of the global demand for vaccines. Moreover, India’s role as the “pharmacy of the world”, with 20 percent of the global production of generic medicines, was validated during the pandemic when it supplied medicine to 133 countries, including developed countries like the United States. This was acknowledged by the secretary general of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, or SCO. Meanwhile, as international affairs scholars Harsh V Pant and Aarshi Tirkey pointed out in Foreign Policy, India was seen supporting the initiative to temporarily suspend intellectual property rights over the Covid vaccines. This was meant to enable faster production of generic versions. India also sponsored the World Health Organisation’s resolution for the global access to the vaccine.

This month, India unrolled, for its citizens, its vaccination programme which would ultimately require billion-plus doses. Along with made-in India vaccines like Covishield (Serum Institute, Pune) and Covaxin (Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad), other companies like Zydus and Gennova are producing indigenous vaccines. There are also examples of foreign collaborations, as the Pune-based Serum Instituted has tied up with Britain’s AstraZeneca.

Three days after the start of the Covid vaccination drive, the ministry of external affairs released a press note on January 19 saying India had received requests for Indian manufactured vaccines from neighbouring and partner countries. It added, “Supplies under grant assistance to Bhutan, Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles will begin from January 20, 2021. In respect of Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Mauritius, we are awaiting their confirmation of necessary regulatory clearances.”

The last few days have seen supplies already reaching some of these countries. Leaders and diplomats of neighbouring countries, and even a South American country like Brazil, thanked India for its supply of the vaccines. According to a report in the Washington Post, India has already sent 3.2 million free doses to Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives, Mauritius, Myanmar and Seychelles. In the next three months, it’s estimated that India would supply 20 million vaccine doses to neighbouring countries before extending the delivery to African and Latin American countries.

On the other hand, vaccine diplomacy could be another arena for Indo-China rivalry in the region. In South Asia, India has emerged as the only potent challenger to Chinese hegemonic ambitions and, hence, both countries could be making an assessment of the extent to which India’s vaccine reach-out could bring diplomatic leverage in the region. This would be particularly relevant to India making a headway in nullifying recent downswings in its ties with Nepal, or even Bangladesh.

Given that China is seen as the country where the virus came from and its dubious conduct in sharing information in the formative stages of the pandemic, China’s drive to supply medicine and vaccines also comes from its anxieties about recovering its soft power.

This, apart from reclaiming a moral cause under which all big powers hide their ambitions, also dovetails with the Chinese urge to be seen as the leader of the developing countries. As Rana Mitter, a professor of history and politics of modern China at Oxford University, wrote in Foreign Affairs, “The use of rhetoric that draws on traditional thought suggests that China, like all states, would prefer its choices to be understood as moral and not just realist ones...That vision of a fundamentally moral China supports another ambition: China’s wish to position itself as the leader of the global South. This aim is not original; during the Cold War, China sought to portray itself as a champion of what was then called the Third World.”

The subtext of Chinese competition on the turf of vaccine diplomacy should alert India to the threats of propaganda against Indian vaccines. The heft of Chinese presence and purse could unleash a disinformation drive to discredit India’s credentials in what’s emerging as global health diplomacy. Much like thinking about an effective communication approach to quell rumours and debunk misinformation about vaccines at home, India’s vaccine outreach should entail anticipation and pre-emption of a possible disinformation campaign.

As the terms of international engagement in a world trying to find its feet while grappling with pandemic shows signs of continuity as well as change, India’s vaccine diplomacy goes beyond mere soft power projection. In the process of generously showcasing its pivotal presence in the global vaccine supply chain, India hopes to reap diplomatic dividends in repairing some recent irritants in its ties with its neighbours and retain its heft as a significant presence within the global South.",,"25 Jan, 2021",Newslaundry,India has got its vaccine diplomacy right,

I","Following the emergence of the covid-19 pandemic global interaction has focussed on dealing with the impact and consequences of it. Public Health diplomacy has acquired a higher place in international discourse at all levels including the G201, regional summits like the East Asia Summit2 and in bilateral discussions.

Countries are engaged in finding solutions to the problems that have emerged in terms of economic and social impact. International diplomacy has focussed on ameliorating the socio-economic problems. New emphasis is now on vaccine diplomacy. This relates to the provision of protective equipment, medical devices, medicines, their manufacture and distribution and finally the vaccine itself.

Traditionally, diplomacy is the process by which a country aggregates its national strength in varied fields and uses it to achieve its national interests. India has been using diplomatic efforts to secure access to technology for Covid-19 related solutions. Each country will of course prioritize the availability of vaccines for their own people at two doses per person. At the same time India has utilised its manufacturing capabilities, as the pharmacy of the world and IT services to reach out to countries across the globe to provide essential medicines like hydro chloroquine, paracetamol, masks and the like.

Vaccine diplomacy refers to two types of approach. The first is as a manufacturer and distributor of vaccines. India is the major producer in the world and has provided the vaccines or medicines for HIV, meningitis and malaria. India is among the largest producers of vaccine covering about 60% for many diseases and is hence well placed to scale those production facilities to manufacture the Covid-19 vaccine.3 Another type of vaccine diplomacy relates to science and research and development where a country can be a part of the development process for new vaccines. India is evolving three possible Covid-19 vaccines and will have licensed production of several others currently being developed overseas. Its robust production facilities and skills provided by its unique place in global production and distribution give its vaccine diplomacy a quiet edge.4

India is in close contact with all the major producers of the new vaccine accept the Chinese. However, it is this ability that India exhibited to Delhi based diplomats when it took them on the tour of the facilities in Hyderabad on 9 December 2020. The group visited the research and manufacturing facilities of the biotechnology companies, Bharat Biotech and Biological E. That saw India’s own efforts to develop Covid-19 vaccines, including current clinical trials.5 India’s R&D facilities, manufacturing capacity, foreign collaborations in pharmaceuticals, including vaccine production, were highlighted. India’s slow and steady approach was appreciated.

Vaccine diplomacy provides a unique opportunity for a revised international cooperation. The demand for the vaccine is global; its development is concentrated in a few countries. Scalable production facilities are available in few countries like India and China. The opportunity for engaging countries in a new diplomatic programme based on vaccines is thus high on the agenda of international cooperation ahead.

India has taken a new initiative along with South Africa to approach the WTO through its TRIPs council and seek a waiver from trade related intellectual property regime for a short duration pertaining to the vaccine6. It also covers medical devices and equipment related to the pandemic. The request was introduced on Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti, 2nd October 2020. However, after two meetings, no agreement was reached since the main producing countries and the countries in which major producing companies are located do not wish to provide this window of exception to developing countries.

India has been joined by Mozambique Brazil and South Asian countries in this quest which has been resisted by Australia, Brazil, Canada, the EU, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. Despite greater strategic convergence with many of these countries, India finds that the traditional fault lines at the WTO continue to hamper international cooperation during a global pandemic.

India will be able to scale up production of the vaccine, supportive equipment and devices including delivery mechanisms without the restriction of patents and trademarks for a limited duration if the exception succeeds. Like in the case of the ARV cocktail of medicines this could be a life saving intervention.7 The developed countries however believe that the investment by their companies must be rewarded even if there is a global pandemic.

In another initiative India is a part of COVAX a GAVI led group of 189 countries excluding the USA. Their aim is to procure 2 billion doses by the end of 2021 of which half will be for lower-income countries to protect high-risk and vulnerable groups, particularly health care workers, across the world.8 Only 20% of the projected requirement is met so far. Advance payments from richer countries are to support the scaled-up production of vaccines which can then be provided to 92 targeted counters as well.

It is understandable that every country would want its own people to be covered first but international cooperation to be meaningful must have an element of sharing at times like this. India has placed commercial orders of nearly two billion dozes with half going to US manufacturers then to the UK and a smaller part to Russia. India is the largest country to place an order but it is unlikely that imported vaccine will be used for vaccine diplomacy.

India has already been quick to offer vaccines when available to its South Asian neighbours like Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and the like and would most certainly share it with Africa. This can be understood from the way that hydro chloroquine and paracetamol were provided in an earlier phase of the pandemic.

Since almost all vaccines are likely to be produced at a large scale in India through the robust efforts of it’s mainly private sector players there would be opportunities for exportable surpluses which would on priority be provided to South Asian neighbours and African countries. While these are likely to be commercially provided at lower costs as available in India there is every possibility that some of these will be as part of grants by the Ministry of External Affairs as part of its vaccine diplomacy. Recently at the India ASEAN Summit the Prime Minister offered $ 1 million support for Covid-19 ASEAN Response Fund9. A $ 10 million health fund already exists for Africa for such diplomacy.

The Asian Development Bank has also announced a $9 billion Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility. This will enable member economies to procure vaccines using this funding facility. This is in addition to a $20 billion package to Asian developing countries deal with the Covid-19 crisis. That facility is focused on supporting government expenditure programmes and financing for private companies10

Beside the vaccine itself, there are new opportunities to deal with the delivery, distribution, cold storage and the like.11 Dubai for West Asia and Ethiopia for Africa are emerging as operational regional centers for vaccine storage and cold chains. They provide airline hubs from where you can reach different countries through their well-connected airlines. India can also take advantage of these regional hubs and its pharmaceutical companies present in a large number of neighbouring and African countries to become a part of this distribution chain.

As part of its ‘Vishwa Guru’ positioning India is well-placed to make a steady diplomatic effort to share its capabilities and emerging technology for Covid-19 vaccines, their utilisation distribution especially among developing countries. Indian production facilities are likely to become the main suppliers for vaccine to most international efforts after the initial surge in capturing production is over.",https://www.vifindia.org/article/2020/december/14/india-and-vaccine-diplomacy,"December 14 , 2020",Vivekananda International Foundation,"

2022/0132,Article,https://www.thebridgechronicle.com/opinion/in-for-a-win-first-worlds-vaccine-nationalism-or-developing-nations-vaccine-maitri,"Since the beginning of the pandemic, vaccines were the best shot at combating the COVID-19 pandemic. With the rise in the number of cases around the world, the desperation to develop a vaccine rose substantially. International collaborations among scientists to develop an effective vaccine became unavoidable - frail understanding between the nations, however, proved to be a major hurdle in reaching the end of the COVID-19 tunnel.

What is Vaccine Nationalism?

The 'my nation first' ideology relating to the unhealthy distribution of vaccines has birthed the concept of Vaccine Nationalism. Developed countries have entered into multi-billion-dollar agreements with various pharmaceuticals for assured supplies of vaccines to their citizens. These agreements mean that if any of the big-wig pharmaceuticals are successful in developing a vaccine, they would have to supply the number of vaccines mentioned in the agreement to the particular country, first.

Also Read | Vaccine Nationalism: When will you get the vaccine?

The developed countries like the US, UK, and the European Union have spent billions of dollars on deals with vaccine developers such as Pfizer Inc, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca; this was even before the efficacy of the vaccines was ascertained. While it is sensible for the governments to prioritise the health of their citizens’ health, a multi-nation drive to facilitate vaccination for people around the globe would have been in every country’s self-interest.

What is Vaccine Maitri?

Vaccination Nationalism has created room for countries like – India, China, and maybe Russia to develop, produce and deliver vaccines in the developing part of the world. This opportunity was a door to Alex's Wonderland as it could potentially bolster their influence and strengthen their ties with other nations. Grabbing the opportunity, India - pharmacy of the world - initiated Vaccine Maitri.

Vaccine Maitri, translates to vaccine friendship, is an initiative by the Indian government towards other countries of the world in helping everyone combat COVID-19 with the ‘Made in India’ vaccines. Under its ‘neighbourhood first’ policy, Bhutan and Maldives became the first countries to receive the vaccine consignments. Following these, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Seychelles, Mauritius, Brazil, Kuwait, Bahrain, among others, have also got packages of – Covishield, Covaxin, and AstraZeneca - the vaccines.On the 75th anniversary of the UN in September 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that India’s vaccine production capacity will help humanity in combating the coronavirus.

How is Vaccine Nationalism destroying the world?

Rajeesh Kumar, an associate fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, recently wrote an article on the institute’s website, mentioning that many of the developed countries are believed to be stockpiling vaccines that are disproportionate with their COVID-19 cases as well as their population. He further elaborates with an example on how Australia, Canada, and Japan have less than one per cent of the world's coronavirus cases, yet, they have pre-ordered more doses of vaccines than all of Latin America and the Caribbean — a region with more than 17 per cent of global coronavirus cases.

India’s capability to produce vaccines

India produces almost 60 per cent of vaccines in the world. Towards the beginning of the pandemic, however, India stumbled a bit but soon the pharmacy of the world pulled up its socks and ramped up the production of essential medicines like paracetamol, hydroxychloroquine, etc. Not only did India prove its efficiency in the production of medicines, but it also emerged as an exporter of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits, ventilators, and masks.

According to IBEF – India Brand Equity Foundation, India’s contribution to the pharmaceutical and biotech workforce is the second largest in the world. The country's domestic pharmaceutical market turnover reached Rs 1.4 lakh crore (US$ 20.03 billion) in 2019, up 9.8% y-o-y from Rs 1.29 lakh crore (US$ 18.12 billion) in 2018. The website further mentions, that ‘Indian drugs are exported to more than 200 countries in the world, with the US being the key market.’How is Vaccine Maitri helping India and strengthening allies?

While most organisations and countries have applauded Modi-government’s Vaccine Maitri, it is not purely out of goodwill that India is ‘oh so graciously’ distributing vaccines to the world.

Experts have been drawing a tangent between the country’s Vaccine Maitri and other policies like Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (The World is One Family), Neighbourhood First, and South-South Cooperation. Though, the initiative is strategically increasing country’s hold over the international Pharma sector, it is understood that India is also aiming to gain soft power over various beneficiaries. Does soft power, however, gain the much-anticipated results?

Dr Vijay Khare, Director, Department of Defence and Strategic Studies at Savitribai Phule Pune University, explains, “In the human history soft diplomacy always plays an important role. Like how countries like the UK offered educational fellowships, with that kind of soft diplomacy they developed a strategic partnership with different countries. In the contemporary world, this (vaccine maitri) would be once of opportunity to develop strategic partnership with neighbouring countries.”

Mentioning soft diplomacy’s limitations, Dr Khare adds, “At the same time, one must not expect that (from the beneficiaries). This is soft diplomacy… and (it) can always change as per the time. So to some extent it gets emotional support from the local population (for the respective country), but when it comes to building better relationships you need hard diplomacy.”

He further adds, “In a contemporary global politics, where China is assertive, (and) Russia is facing internal turbulence, India can play an important role through this soft diplomacy… Ultimately what is important for each individual nation is its national interest. So in that way if (one) considers that through this Vaccine Maitri, (one) will get all the support that will not happen. It would be (certainly) help to strengthen strategic partnership, but (one must) always prepare with hard diplomacy. As long COVID 19 is there, each one will talk, each one will appreciate, but after COVID-19 or when the situation normalise people will forget, and then they will bounce back to their own strategic issues.”

In the race to win!

Even though India is not a player in vaccine politics, it is certainly leading the vaccine diplomacy drive. Indian government’s aim to win over conflicts through soft diplomacy may not yield the kind of result on hoped for, the country however has put itself on the map among more powerful countries.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/thebridgechronicle%2F2020-12%2F97651919-0af0-45ad-a83c-907837ca1a5c%2Fvaccine_web_animated.gif?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&format=webp&w=768&dpr=2.0,"5 Aug, 2021",The bridge Chronicle,In for a win: Developed nations' 'Vaccine Nationalism' or developing nation’s 'Vaccine Maitri'?,

Over the past week, Delhi has exported around four million doses of domestically-manufactured jabs to Iran, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar – all developing nations that have struggled with vaccine shortages.

In early 2021, India keenly pursued a soft power policy of vaccine diplomacy to counter neighbouring China’s growing regional influence. 

Until a ban was enforced in March, it had exported around 60 million doses to other South Asian countries and the World Health Organization’s vaccine sharing programme, Covax.

But, India was then devastated by a second wave of Covid-19 in the late spring – driven by the more Delta variant and exacerbated as few of its 1.38 billion citizens had been vaccinated – so doses were held to meet domestic demand.

Public pressure had also risen rapidly on the Indian government to scale-up its stuttering vaccination programme, which was initially beset by production and logistical delays, rather than score political points internationally. A decision to export five million doses to the affluent United Kingdom drew considerable ire.

However, India's vaccination production has accelerated rapidly since the spring. This is largely due to the Serum Institute of India (SII), which manufactures the AstraZeneca/Oxford University ‘Covishield’ vaccine, scaling up to 200 million doses a month. Over two-thirds of Indian adults have now received their first dose.

While exports are only expected to recommence slowly in October they are expected to grow significantly by January. The Indian government estimates its domestic monthly production of doses will rise to 300-320 million in January as other locally developed vaccines clear regulatory approvals.

Currently, India is administering an average of 210 million doses each month and so this expected surplus can be exported.
“As India’s needs are met, going forward there will be a generous stockpile of vaccines,” said VK Paul, who heads the Indian government’s task force on Covid-19.

“A huge, huge availability of vaccines can be visualised for next year, we expect vaccines made in India to play a significant role in dealing with the pandemic across the world.”

Last week, Adar Poonawalla, the CEO of the SII, told The Telegraph that his company remained committed to providing one billion doses of its Covishield vaccine to Covax by the end of 2022.

Mr Poonawalla said the SII would prioritise lower-income countries globally through Covax rather than selling doses to be used as booster shots in developed nations.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/global-health/2021/01/04/TELEMMGLPICT000247848877_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqA7N2CxnJWnYI3tCbVBgu9T0aesusvN1TE7a0ddd_esI.jpeg?imwidth=960,14 October 2021,The  Telegraph,India resumes vaccine exports after two-thirds of adults receive a first dose,

India, which has the second-largest population in the world, declared a complete lockdown on 23 March 2020 to control the spread of the Wuhan Virus, since the occurrence of the first case of the above said virus on 30 January 2020. In spite of announcing a series of measures like quarantine for infected individuals and social distancing for all, on 25 March 2020, a US-based foreign affairs magazine predicted catastrophe for India. A few months later, in July 2020, Boston Review, called India’s Wuhan Virus response a ‘Humanitarian Disaster’. In August 2020, Scientific American magazine claimed ‘India is in denial about COVID-19 crisis’. In October 2020, BBC declared ‘New Delhi is staring at Corona Virus disaster’. The pandemic in India is now 10 months old. The BBC now reports that the UK records 1564 daily deaths. CNN reports that the UK hospitals look like ‘War Zones’. India, on the other hand, has got a grip on the pandemic. The daily cases in India have fallen to the lowest since June 2020. When the developed nations in the world are focused on their own problems, India is nursing other countries back to health.

India’s Healing Touch

As early as June 2020, the Serum Institute of India announced an investment of 100 million USD for the potential COVID-19 vaccine2. India is now driving the world’s biggest vaccination program to vaccinate its 1.3 billion citizens. By July 2021, India plans to immunise at least 300 million people which is almost the population of the US. India has trained 2,00,000 vaccinators and 3,70,000 team members and has readied 29,000 cold storage.

India is not just vaccinating its own citizens but also vaccinating its neighbours and beyond. India has gifted 1,50,000 doses of COVID vaccine to Bhutan, 1,00,000 vaccines to Maldives, 10,00,000 doses to Nepal, 20,00,000 doses to Bangladesh and 15,00,000 doses to Myanmar. Indian vaccine has also reached Seychelles, Mauritius, Brazil, and Morocco free of cost. Sri Lanka and Afghanistan are next on the list. UK and Belgium have shown interest in buying the Indian vaccine. Dominica has sent an SOS letter to the PM of India for a donation of 70,000 doses. Other African and West Asian nations like South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria, UAE, and Saudi Arabia are looking forward to Indian vaccine. India, known as the world’s pharmacy, is also home to a large number of USFDA approved vaccine manufacturing plants having top-notch standards. While world stopped export of the medicines, India exported Hydroxychloroquine, REMDESIVIR, Paracetamol tablets, diagnosis kits, ventilators, masks, gloves and medical essentials to various countries. Vaccine plants across the world are tying up with Indian pharmaceutical companies for manufacturing the vaccine as the Indian vaccine is cost-effective and safe.  India, at present, is home to the world’s largest manufacturer ie The Serum Institute of India having a capacity of producing 1.5 billion vaccines annually. The UKs Glaxosmithkline – the nearest rival – has less than half the capacity. India will cater for 50% of the global demand for COVID vaccine. The Serum Institute of India will also supply 200 million of vaccines to COVAX alliance to distribute vaccines to poorer countries.

India The Rising Super Power

While the Western World is looking inwards during the pandemic, India has emerged as a world leader and reaffirmed the faith with its friendly nations across the world. As early as April 2020, PM of India Mr. Narender Modi pitched for a joint strategy to combat the pandemic, formed the COVID-19 emergency fund, and pledged 10 million USD for the same. India has advocated the availability of medicines across the globe through international cooperation and development partnerships and signed a UN resolution to ensure fair and equitable access to essential medical supplies and vaccines developed to fight COVID-19.5 The move to provide medicines has further increased India’s goodwill in the region and abroad. If the region starts to vaccinate at the same time, it can recover faster economically, and travel within the region can become faster and easier3.

China’s Global Times tweeted ‘India hopes to counter the international influence of Chinese vaccines, even if China has always set its own pace and has no intention of competing’. While China is attempting to buy support, India is working towards supporting the world. India’s response to its neighbours call has been proactive rather than reactive. India has helped Nepal by deploying military doctors to support the local management of COVID, has supported the Maldives to kick start its economy through tourism and free vaccination, helped Sri Lanka and Myanmar to get free from the pandemic. India is steadily stepping into a leadership role and is displaying compassion which has never been seen before. India is engaged via the world through G-20 and bilateral interaction with over 100 countries through virtual conversations to enhance the global pandemic response. Rapid response team of doctors, nurses and paramedics have also been deployed in Kuwait on the request.

India, in manufacturing and supplying COVID medicine to it’s neighbours, has proved to the world that India is on track in its vision to be an Atmnirbhar Bharat. The provision of vaccines to its friendly neighbours and many other countries has reestablished the fact that India is a true friend who can be trusted during testing times. While tackling pandemic, India has risen taller above the other countries in the world. India is leveraging the COVID pandemic for enhancing diplomatic relations with more than 85 countries across the world. Even in the time of the pandemic, much before it’s citizens are vaccinated, India is following the policy – neighbourhood first and healing the South East Asian region with the highest population density. India, thus, moves forward with the principle of ‘Whole world is one family’ or Vasudev Kutumbhakam’.

PM Modi has announced “India is ready to save humanity with COVID vaccine”. India’s vaccine diplomacy will, thus, generate goodwill. Many world leaders and personalities like Bill Gates and WHO Chief have lauded India’s efforts to end the pandemic. Multilateral agencies such as UNICEF too have been provided with global supplies by India. The UN Secretary-General ‘saluted’ India for extending solidarity across borders in fighting the devastating pandemic.

Way Ahead

Transnational transmission of health risks in a globalised world is a new reality. In view of New Delhi’s soft power approach strategically, COVID diplomacy holds crucial importance in terms of the extent of its impact as well as its greater sustainability. India must, therefore, leverage COVID diplomacy for following:-

Widen mutual economic engagement for Indian entrepreneurs in medical and other related as well as non-related sectors like medical research, medical equipment manufacturing, aviation, shipping, and hospitality(for medical tourists) with friendly countries, initiate engagement with countries with strained bilateral ties and mark Indian presence in geo-strategically important locations.
Play a pivotal role in strengthening WHO to deal with future pandemics by promoting international cooperation and creation of a global transnational response mechanism for any future pandemic.
Leverage its initiatives in supporting the development of medical infrastructure and growth of the healthcare sectors of other friendly nations by enhancing medical exports and thus offer the much-awaited space for medical start-ups as well as India’s public and private players through Joint ventures.
Explore opportunities in the fields of traditional Indian remedies offering fitness and wellness including Yoga, Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and Homeopathy that offer India an exclusive, competitive advantage over other global players.
Establish a comprehensive data and expertise sharing platform for extended neighbourhood countries to include BIMSTEC, CAR, West Asia, South East Asia, and Indo Pacific to ensure adequate and timely sharing of data to ease processes of providing relief and assistance.
Ensuring adequate space to COVID diplomacy has never been more imminent. With the wide-reaching implications of the impacts and causes of health security on overall national security and stability of the countries, ignorance towards this sector comes with significant opportunity costs. While it must be acknowledged that like every other aspect of international diplomacy, COVID diplomacy too shall be incapable to singularly bear many fruits, it is, therefore, time that it is recognised at par with other traditionally relevant diplomacies. It will only be in the time that one shall be able to assess how far India can flex its diplomatic muscle through its medical sector to make use of this opportunity to be a game-changer in the world order.",,"January 26, 2021",claws,Vaccine Diplomacy – A Game Changer In World Order,
2022/0135,Article,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2021/01/27/commentary/world-commentary/free-vaccines-india-coronavirus-diplomacy/,"Large parts of the world are still reeling from the spread of the coronavirus, with renewed lockdowns in effect in many places. With every stricken country focused on tackling its COVID-19 crisis, there is little international generosity in donating large quantities of medicines or vaccines when demand for them is sky-high.

So, when India in recent days delivered millions of COVID-19 vaccines as gifts to countries in the Indian Ocean region, it attracted international attention.

More than 5 million Indian-made vaccines were airlifted last week to countries extending from Myanmar and Bangladesh to Mauritius and the Seychelles. And millions of more free vaccines are on their way this week.

The scale of India’s vaccine gifts is unrivaled. No other country has delivered millions of free vaccines to other nations — not even China, which has pursued its own vaccine diplomacy in a bid to repair the damage to its global image from the spread of the deadly coronavirus from Chinese soil. The gifts help to highlight India’s enormous vaccine-manufacturing capacity.

What stands out the most about India’s humanitarian gesture is that it was launched just four days after the country began vaccinating its own citizens, starting with health care workers. On receiving the first shipment of Indian vaccines, the prime minister of the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan called it “altruism” that “precious commodities are shared even before meeting your own needs.” The overseas vaccine shipments extend from India’s ambitious plan to inoculate its huge 1.3 billion population in one of the world’s biggest COVID-19 vaccination drives.

India’s free-vaccine diplomacy, however, has been driven by more than altruism. There are geopolitical considerations at play, including building goodwill and influence and countering China’s growing strategic footprint in the Indian Ocean region. Supplying free vaccines to combat a raging pandemic also seems a better choice for New Delhi than providing direct aid in another form.

One of India’s strengths is that it supplies more than 60% of the world’s vaccines against various diseases. Now, it is leveraging that manufacturing heft by embarking on what has been billed as humanitarian diplomacy — the supply of free vaccines to countries in its extended neighborhood.

Its extensive vaccine-manufacturing infrastructure also explains why India, as research by Fitch Solutions suggests, will be able to inoculate most of its vulnerable citizens such as health care workers and the elderly by mid-2021 — ahead of the much-smaller South Korea, for example.

India already has agreed to supply more than one billion coronavirus vaccines to various countries and to the World Health Organization-backed Covax initiative aimed at poorer countries. India is currently manufacturing two vaccines — the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, known in India as Covishield, and Covaxin, developed by the Indian pharmaceutical firm Bharat Biotech. Three other Indian companies are close to wrapping up development of their own vaccines.

Before India granted emergency approval to Covishield and Covaxin in early January, the privately-owned Serum Institute of India (SII) — the world’s largest maker of vaccines by volume and the leading production partner of AstraZeneca-Oxford — had already manufactured and stocked between 70 to 80 million Covishield doses. This large stockpile has meant that India has enough vaccines to share with other countries.

Furthermore, India’s rapidly falling coronavirus infections have given Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government greater room to advance vaccine diplomacy. Daily new cases in India — a distant second to the United States in aggregate infections — have dramatically declined since last fall.

The international spotlight on the competitive vaccine offerings of the United States, Britain, Russia and China has helped obscure India’s role. Since the pandemic began, India has quietly donated or commercially exported crucial items that have encountered massive demand surges, such as COVID-19 test kits, personal protection equipment and medicines for coronavirus symptoms. India, the world’s leading supplier of generic drugs, shipped 50 million tablets of hydroxychloroquine to the United States last spring at then-American President Donald Trump’s request.

China, while exploiting its pharmaceutical clout for commercial ends throughout the pandemic, has thus far announced only modest vaccine donations. Its aggressive push to sell vaccines to developing nations, however, has suffered a setback after its leading inoculation candidate turned out to be just 50% effective in late-stage trials in Brazil. Indeed, Brazil has turned to India, importing 2 million vaccines in recent days.

Against this background, will India’s vaccine diplomacy tangibly aid its foreign-policy interests? As more than 100,000 war-ready Indian and Chinese troops remain locked in a months-long Himalayan military standoff, India feels increasingly hemmed in by the expanding Chinese influence in its neighborhood.

India is hoping that, in contrast to the coronavirus’s indelible association with China as the country of origin, it will be remembered for helping many of its neighbors to immunize the vulnerable segments of their populations against the disease.

Still, with China spreading its influence deep into India’s backyard, New Delhi can scarcely reverse its eroding regional clout with just the goodwill generated from its large vaccine donations. India needs to do a lot more on a sustained basis. This demands it shed its intrinsic diffidence in favor of proactive diplomacy.

In fact, there is the question of whether India will bear the financial burden of supplying more free coronavirus vaccines to neighboring countries beyond the initial shipments. The issue whether such vaccines will be free for all of India’s own citizens has yet to be settled.

India’s large overseas shipments, however, belie the current Western narrative that wealthy nations are monopolizing the supply of COVID-19 vaccines and fueling a widening gap in access around the world. As with the shots against many other diseases, from polio and pneumonia to meningitis and measles, India is likely to be the largest and most-affordable source of COVID-19 vaccines, especially as new inoculation candidates enter into Indian production after approval.

The paradox is that many wealthy countries, especially in the European Union, have been slow to roll out COVID-19 vaccines, making India’s robust vaccine industry stand out as a model.

The Indian industry’s role will be central to ending the pandemic because only India has the vast infrastructure at present to meet the global vaccine demand. However, the extensive damage and five deaths from last week’s major fire at a new building at the SII campus were a reminder that, at a time when many low- and middle-income countries are depending on Indian production, unforeseen events could potentially disrupt supply of essential vaccines.",https://cdn-japantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/np_file_65746-1.jpeg,"Jan 27, 2021",the japan times,Free vaccines and India’s humanitarian diplomacy,
2022/0136,Article,https://jamestown.org/program/chinas-vaccine-diplomacy-revamps-the-health-silk-road-amid-covid-19/,"Introduction

As global COVID-19 cases exceed 51 million, a top health official from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has predicted that China is “very likely” to avoid a winter coronavirus outbreak, adding that the coronavirus situation in China was “very safe overall” (Caixin, November 11). The head of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) expressed similar optimism in September when he noted that widespread vaccinations likely would not be necessary in China due to the country’s effective control of the outbreak (SCMP, September 13).

At the same time, Chinese researchers have raced to develop a viable COVID-19 vaccine, sometimes skirting vaccine development norms in the process and already inoculating hundreds of thousands of people under “emergency use authorizations” (Caixin, September 8).[1] While countries experiencing high coronavirus caseloads in the West have reportedly stockpiled pre-purchases of vaccines, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary and PRC President Xi Jinping has repeatedly pledged to make a COVID-19 vaccine “a global public good”, available to all (Xinhua, May 18).

Chinese Vaccine Diplomacy

China made headlines in October when it signed on to COVAX, a UN-led program aiming to promote equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for developing countries (CGTN, October 9). But with large states such as the U.S. and Russia failing to sign on to the initiative, COVAX has failed to raise even a tenth of the $35 billion that is needed to successfully scale up vaccine distribution worldwide (WHO, September 21). In separate deals, Chinese leaders have promised to provide $1 billion in loans to help Latin American and Caribbean countries purchase vaccines (China Daily, July 27), and to distribute free vaccines across Africa and Southeast Asia (Xinhua, June 18; Asia Times, August 26). For some countries, China promised to provide vaccines in return for aid in carrying out safety trials (The News (PK), August 14; Yicai Global, October 16).[2] For others, promises of vaccine doses have been connected with pressures to agree to specific foreign policy objectives, echoing the strings often attached to China’s heavy-handed “mask diplomacy” earlier in the pandemic.[3]

After stumbling in its initial response to the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese government has boldly leveraged the chaos of the pandemic to pursue strategic gains at the expense of longstanding norms: challenging territorial designations along the Indian border and in the South China Sea as well as contesting Taiwanese sovereignty; and cracking down on domestic security issues in Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia. At the same time, China has worked to rehabilitate its international reputation, which was dealt a bad blow by the coronavirus.

Diplomats charged with “telling China’s story well” (??????, jianghao zhongguo gushi) have hit back hard against allegations of Chinese wrongdoing during the pandemic, calling such criticisms a “political virus” (????, zhengzhi bingdu) that must be fought alongside the coronavirus (PLA Daily, May 22). In June, the Chinese government published a white paper that sought to clarify the narrative of China’s triumph against COVID-19 and present its (airbrushed) experiences as a model for emulation (China Daily, June 8). In the context of this strategic propaganda push, China’s vaccine diplomacy becomes another tool for promoting its position as a responsible global leader amid the ongoing health crisis.As the pandemic began to spread around the world, China moved quickly to ship medical supplies to more than 120 countries (Xinhua, April 4). In some instances, but not all, COVID-19 aid shipments were organized via preexisting transit pathways connected along the BRI.  For example, shipments of medical supplies to Argentina were coordinated by existing BRI partners that had previously been involved in building hydroelectric dams in Argentina’s Santa Cruz province, and China’s close public health cooperation with states like Saudi Arabia and Italy were facilitated by the countries’ memberships in the BRI (Xinhua, May 21; Belt and Road News, May 21; CGTN, August 26).

The Health Silk Road has also been explicitly connected with the Digital Silk Road (DSR), another lesser-known BRI program aimed at enhancing digital connectivity which has also been revitalized this year (Belt and Road News, May 20). Human rights watchers fear that as China touts its successful handling of the pandemic via the vehicle of the HSR, it may also seek to export related health surveillance technologies to other countries via the DSR.

Although a degree of public health surveillance is needed to mount an effective response to infectious diseases, China’s wide-ranging collection of sensitive personal data as part of its response to the coronavirus did not include adequate protections for citizens’ privacy. Additionally, cybersecurity experts have warned that the public health crisis contributed to an escalation of China’s already oppressive authoritarian surveillance regime, and that new surveillance technologies (such as the Health QR Code) are not likely to go away anytime soon even though China has largely controlled the domestic spread of the coronavirus.[4] In short, China’s surveillance regime underwent a massive expansion in response to the necessity of controlling COVID-19, and it seems likely that China will continue to leverage BRI linkages to export its repressive toolkit to authoritarian countries around the world as the pandemic continues.

Conclusion

Following China’s promise to invest in a long-awaited Africa CDC earlier this year, some had hoped that the HSR’s renewal earlier this year could drive China to learn from the lessons of past epidemics and work to overcome historic structural shortcomings in the developing world (The China Story, September 17). But the evidence of China’s bilateral vaccine diplomacy seems to indicate that China has adopted a dual strategy for cementing its position as a global health leader: simultaneously publicizing its involvement in multilateral initiatives to appear a responsible participant in the global system while also pursuing bilateral deals on the side that maximize its power and influence.

China was able to burnish its international reputation as a responsible global stakeholder by joining the COVAX initiative in October, but details of its subsequent participation in the multilateral group (such as the amount of financial support provided or contributions to COVAX’s procurement “pool” vaccine supply) remain murky. Because COVAX has so far failed to achieve its funding goals, it is unlikely that it will be able to supply much of the globe’s vaccine needs, and developing countries will still need to source at least a portion of their vaccine supplies elsewhere.

Crucially, China’s bilateral deals to supply vaccines to developing countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America have bypassed international standards on vaccine development, raising major ethical concerns. They could also present an opportunity for Chinese suppliers to negotiate higher prices than pooled purchases would have achieved. A report by Nikkei Asia has also noted that vaccine guarantees of immunity to COVID-19 may be short-lived; countries may have to source repeated inoculations to keep their populations safe, creating longer-term dependencies on vaccine suppliers (Nikkei Asia, November 4).

Regardless of how it is done, supplying developing nations with a viable COVID-19 vaccine would mark a major triumph for China’s biopharmaceuticals industry, which has been historically wracked by quality scandals and previously served primarily domestic consumers.[5] China’s vaccine diplomacy stands to benefit the country economically and politically, underscoring the development of a global health system in which Chinese influence dominates.

Origins of the Health Silk Road

In 2015, China’s National Health and Family Planning Commission released a three year plan to establish “health cooperation networks” with countries participating in China’s grand foreign policy Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) (China Daily, December 18, 2015). The Health Silk Road (HSR, ??????, jiankang sichou zhilv) was officially established as a joint initiative with the WHO at the beginning of 2017. Following a Belt and Road Forum for Health Cooperation headlined by the WHO Director-General later in the year, China published a “health silk road communiqué” signed by 30-odd countries, the WHO, and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (Xinhua, August 18, 2017). Despite its strong initial rollout, the HSR largely fell out of the public eye over the next two years.

The role of traditional medicine was noticeably championed during the initial rollout of HSR; China has long pushed applications of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) abroad as a means of bolstering its international soft power (and expanding a valuable domestic industry to new markets) (China Daily, January 19, 2017; Belt and Road News, March 27). Interestingly, it has continued to do so during the COVID-19 pandemic even though there is little to no scientific evidence of TCM’s efficacy in treating novel diseases (Xinhua: March 19, April 15, October 26).

It is worth taking a moment to note the difference between the HSR and other multilateral organizations for global health cooperation such as the WHO: China expert Nadegé Rolland has described the HSR as “not a multilateral institution per se,” but rather a “hub-and-spoke organism…[with] China at the center [and] multiple bilateral arms extending outward” (Axios, April 15). This distinction is important. While true multilateral organizations provide a relatively equalizing mechanism for inter-state diplomacy and dialogue, the balance of power in a hub-and-spoke model is weighted towards the center.

Revitalizing the HSR and BRI After COVID-19

The HSR has been connected with China’s strategic foreign policy Belt and Road Initiative since its beginnings. And like the BRI, the HSR has proven difficult to define or quantify. This vagueness has lent a certain narrative flexibility, allowing propagandists to freely utilize the term while simultaneously avoiding the need to adhere to concrete measurements of success. Analysts have noted the BRI’s reframing to address new economic goals amid a changing international situation in the wake of COVID-19 (China Brief, September 28). The HSR has been similarly revamped to fit Chinese propagandists’ evolving rhetorical needs in 2020.

The HSR was first referenced in connection with COVID-19 during a phone call between Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his Italian counterpart Luigi Di Maio on February 28 (MFA (China), February 28). Following this, Xi Jinping began alluding to the HSR in discussions of coronavirus-related aid with several heads of government in mid-March (Xinhua: March 17, March 21). On March 24, a People’s Daily commentary emphasized the renewed importance of HSR as a platform for BRI cooperation and as a means of contributing to global health governance (People’s Daily, March 24). Local media also explicitly tied China’s distribution of coronavirus aid to its BRI linkages (Sina, March 26).",https://jamestown.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/chen_1.png,11/12/2020,The Jamestown Foundation,China’s Vaccine Diplomacy Revamps the Health Silk Road Amid COVID-19,

Low vaccination rates in poorer countries have little to do with so-called “vaccine hesitancy” according to a study that examined access to COVID-19 tools across 14 low-income countries.

World Health Organization (WHO) show that only 16 per cent of people in low-income countries have received a single COVID-19 vaccine dose, compared to 80 per cent in high-income countries, some of which are already rolling out a fourth booster shot.

Some pharmaceutical companies have blamed a reluctance to accept the vaccine, rather than supply shortages, for poor vaccination rates, especially in less wealthy countries.

“There is little doubt that the vaccine hesitancy narrative is rooted in racism and colonialism and the idea that certain people don’t know how to do certain things,”
Fifa Rahman, principal consultant, Matahari Global Solutions
But the joint report by Matahari Global Solutions, the People’s Vaccine Alliance and the International Treatment Preparedness Coalition (ITPC) found that inadequate supply of vaccines and treatments, underfunding of health systems and poor adaptation to local needs were behind the low coverage.



Fifa Rahman, principal consultant at the global health research and policy group Matahari and lead author of the report, said there were several fundamental reasons why people were not accessing vaccines, not simply an outright distrust of the drugs.

“There is little doubt that the vaccine hesitancy narrative is rooted in racism and colonialism and the idea that certain people don’t know how to do certain things,” Rahman told an online press conference last week (25 August). “It has to be more nuanced, otherwise it’s lazy and problematic.”

While Rahman acknowledged that concerns relating to technologies derived from western companies were a legacy of colonialism, she said many of the vaccine access obstacles were structural. “Because experiments have happened in the past on black bodies, so people are concerned, but this is not to say people distrust vaccines,” Rahman said.

2022/0138,Article,https://www.vox.com/22309620/chile-covid-19-vaccination-campaign,"Dr. Joxelin Flores Taborda, who is based in Santiago, Chile, got her second dose of Coronavac last week. She had a little headache afterward. But “a good headache,” she called it. “I was thinking, ‘The vaccine is doing something inside me.’”

Flores is a pediatrician who specializes in pulmonology. She and her colleagues who work in health care were among the first to receive vaccines at the start of Chile’s Covid-19 vaccination campaign in early February.

Since then, Chile has administered about 5 million vaccine doses, giving at least one shot to nearly a quarter of its population of around 19 million. The country’s vaccination campaign has far outpaced the rest of Latin America and much of the world. Chile has set a goal of delivering at least one dose to 15 million people by the end of June.Getting vaccines was a priority, so Chile sought deals with a variety of makers — making bets on many different types of vaccines from different places: China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and through the multilateral effort Covax. Chile also participated in phase 3 clinical trials for many vaccine candidates, which gave the country an edge in negotiating for doses.

“But we just didn’t have to have vaccines in Chile, we have to put the vaccines to the people. We have to inoculate,” Paula Daza, Chile’s vice minister for public health, told me. “And here, Chile has a history of successful vaccination campaigns where primary care plays a very, very elementary role in reaching the entire population.”

Chile did this by relying on already-in-place health infrastructure and a century-old tradition of mass immunization campaigns. “Chile has a robust primary health care system and a functional national immunization program with electronic records, which has helped set up a rapid, organized vaccination campaign,” Eduardo Undurraga, a public health expert and assistant professor at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, told me in an email.

Chile built on those systems by trying to meet people where they are, setting up vaccination sites at universities and stadiums. Chile’s Ministry of Health publishes a calendar that clearly says who’s eligible for a vaccine on what day, no appointment necessary. A national immunization registry means it’s easy to keep track of when people get their shots and when they’re due for their second dose, no matter where they are. The #YoMeVacuno (“I get vaccinated”) cards that people have been posing with on social media are just an added perk.

Chile’s Covid-19 record is, like so many other places, mixed: The country saw a big surge in new infections in its fall and winter months, forcing a tight lockdown as cases threatened to overwhelm the health care system. Chile’s most vulnerable populations were also hit the hardest, a reality that reflected the larger debate playing out in Chile about the country’s inequality. All of this put pressure on the government and further deteriorated its popularity.

An effective vaccination campaign is an antidote to that. But Chile’s vaccination successes come as the country has seen some of its biggest coronavirus case spikes in months.Getting vaccines was a priority, so Chile sought deals with a variety of makers — making bets on many different types of vaccines from different places: China, the United Kingdom, the United States, and through the multilateral effort Covax. Chile also participated in phase 3 clinical trials for many vaccine candidates, which gave the country an edge in negotiating for doses.Chile bought a lot of vaccine doses — from everyone
Chile reported its first case of Covid-19 on March 3, 2020. Planning for the country’s vaccination campaign began in the weeks after that, in April and May, Daza, Chile’s vice minister for public health, said. According to her, the different ministries of Sebastian Piñera’s government — science and technology, health, and international affairs, just to name a few — all coordinated on a plan to seek out safe and effective vaccines.

The idea was to get a big portfolio of vaccines, all of which relied on slightly different technologies. And to get them from as many different makers as possible. “Early on they really diversified — they looked at Western, as well as some of the Chinese, products. They joined Covax,” Katherine Bliss, a senior fellow in global health policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told me.

Chile spread its risk around, making these pre-purchase deals even before the vaccines’ efficacy and safety were confirmed. “They purchased from different mechanisms, and way ahead of time,” Arachu Castro, the Samuel Z. Stone Endowed Chair of Public Health in Latin America at Tulane University, told me.

“Because they purchased more vaccines than were needed to cover the population, that, of course, has also been criticized for limiting access to other countries. But definitely for the Chilean population, it’s been an advantage.”

Chile also opened itself up to host phase 3 clinical trials for several Covid-19 vaccine candidates, including for Sinovac’s Coronavac, and the ones made by Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, and CanSino Biologics, Inc., a Chinese pharmaceutical company. This “gave them both experience with the different vaccines and the different companies, but also perhaps an edge in terms of negotiating access to doses,” Bliss said.

“But we just didn’t have to have vaccines in Chile, we have to put the vaccines to the people. We have to inoculate,” Paula Daza, Chile’s vice minister for public health, told me. “And here, Chile has a history of successful vaccination campaigns where primary care plays a very, very elementary role in reaching the entire population.”

Chile did this by relying on already-in-place health infrastructure and a century-old tradition of mass immunization campaigns. “Chile has a robust primary health care system and a functional national immunization program with electronic records, which has helped set up a rapid, organized vaccination campaign,” Eduardo Undurraga, a public health expert and assistant professor at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, told me in an email.

Chile built on those systems by trying to meet people where they are, setting up vaccination sites at universities and stadiums. Chile’s Ministry of Health publishes a calendar that clearly says who’s eligible for a vaccine on what day, no appointment necessary. A national immunization registry means it’s easy to keep track of when people get their shots and when they’re due for their second dose, no matter where they are. The #YoMeVacuno (“I get vaccinated”) cards that people have been posing with on social media are just an added perk.

Chile’s Covid-19 record is, like so many other places, mixed: The country saw a big surge in new infections in its fall and winter months, forcing a tight lockdown as cases threatened to overwhelm the health care system. Chile’s most vulnerable populations were also hit the hardest, a reality that reflected the larger debate playing out in Chile about the country’s inequality. All of this put pressure on the government and further deteriorated its popularity.

An effective vaccination campaign is an antidote to that. But Chile’s vaccination successes come as the country has seen some of its biggest coronavirus case spikes in months.And Chile really does have a lot of promised vaccine doses on the books. As of March 1, according to the Ministry of Finance, the country has an agreement for 14 million doses with Sinovac (of which it has already received nearly 10 million); 10 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech (of which it has received about 700,000); up to 4 million from AstraZeneca; and up to 4 million one-shot vaccines from Johnson & Johnson.

Chile is also a contributing member to Covax, the multilateral vaccine effort, and is expecting 7.6 million doses through that facility. Covax is delivering vaccines for free to dozens of low-income countries, but contributors like Chile also have access to the facility’s vaccine portfolio, and, in return, get the ability to choose which vaccine candidates they receive from Covax, Magdalena Bastías, a representative for the Pan-American Health Organization, told me in an email.

Chile is also reportedly negotiating with the Institute Gamaleya in Russia for its Sputnik V vaccine and with the Chinese-Canadian company CanSino Biologics.

In other words, the country is buying from pretty much everyone, everywhere. To do this, it deployed a kind of agnostic vaccine diplomacy. “They decided not to align themselves geopolitically,” Castro, of Tulane University, said.

If a country or company was making a vaccine, Santiago was open to it. “One of the most important things is that political considerations were not put on the table, never,” Daza said. “It was science, it was technical.”

Some experts also credited Chile’s openness and free trade policies under the administration of the center-right president Sebastián Piñero for the country’s success in acquiring vaccines.

For some, it’s proof that there is a benefit to having a former billionaire businessman who is an efficient dealmaker in charge of the country. Others point to a successful vaccination campaign as Piñera’s only lifeline out of his poor handling of the pandemic and abysmal approval ratings, fueled by social and political unrest in Chile that predated the pandemic.

But experts also noted the country put a particularly big bet on the Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac, which manufactures the Coronavac vaccine. Cristóbal Cuadrado, an assistant professor at the school of public health at the Universidad de Chile, told me that this was a bit of a gamble on Chile’s part, though it has paid off.

This was a wager partially driven by necessity, as Chile would have a much easier time getting to the front of the line for these doses.

That’s because many of the world’s high-income nations, like the United States or European Union countries, were not trying to make deals for the Sinovac vaccine. That gave Chile a degree of access and priority that might have been tougher with big manufacturers like Pfizer and AstraZeneca.

Cuadrado also pointed out that Chilean universities already had some longstanding partnerships with Chinese researchers, including collaborations on vaccines, and the Chilean government invested in those partnerships for the Covid-19 vaccine.This also helped bring public legitimacy to the Sinovac vaccine that was otherwise being somewhat ignored by Western countries, Cuadrado said — which also helped mitigate some of the public skepticism around the Sinovac vaccine.

Undurraga, the public health expert at Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, told me public opinion polls in Chile suggest that people favor Covid-19 vaccines made in Europe or the United States over China or Russia — but that, above all else, people want to get vaccinated as soon as possible. There have been some questions about the Sinovac vaccine’s efficacy and transparency that have raised concerns, but, Undurraga said, “there is substantial agreement that the vaccine will save many lives.”

Sinovac’s Coronavac is the dose most Chileans are getting right now, making up the bulk of the more than 4 million distributed, compared to just hundreds of thousands who have gotten the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Those I’ve talked to who’ve gotten the Coronavac vaccine all say the same thing: Any vaccine is better than none at all.

And, as it stands now, Chile has more than enough committed vaccine doses to vaccinate its population twice over. That, though, is just the first part of the equation.

“The government of Chile was able to secure a high amount of vaccines, and that has been an achievement,” Francisca Crispi, a professor of public health at the Universidad de Chile and the president of the Colegio Medico for the Santiago region, told me. “But, on the other hand, how do you get those vaccines to people all over the country?”

It helps to have experience with immunization programs
Chile doesn’t have a huge population, but the population it does have is spread across the country’s more than 3,000-mile length along South America’s western coast, along with some rural and remote areas.

To get Covid-19 vaccine doses into people’s arms, Chile relied on its deep experience with mass immunization programs and its public primary-health care system that works all over the country.Chile has a hybrid public-private health care model, which has been criticized for creating inequities in care. But its strong public primary-health care network has served as the backbone of the Covid-19 vaccination campaign. Public clinics exist in communities across the country, and they’re deeply connected to those communities, too.

That system has traditionally helped carry out vaccination campaigns, of which Chile also has a long tradition. Chile’s National Immunization Program has roots that go back more than a century, to efforts in the late 1800s against smallpox. The country has undertaken a seasonal flu campaign since the 1980s, and the program also has practice launching rapid vaccination campaigns in response to emergencies like natural disasters, the Pan-American Health Organization’s Bastías said.

This existing infrastructure and experience allowed Chile to be ready to start a Covid-19 vaccination campaign “from day zero,” Rafael Araos, scientific adviser for Covid-19 with Chile’s Ministry of Health, wrote in an email.“Once vaccines eventually arrived, we were able to distribute and vaccinate the population efficiently,” Araos said. “People know and trust the program from successful prior experiences, which is also super important to succeed.”

Beyond public health clinics, Chile set up mobile vaccination centers in markets, universities, and soccer stadiums, and even created drive-through centers for shots. The country has now established more than 1,400 vaccination centers.

“They’ve done a really good job of going to universities and markets and other places where people are, as opposed to them having to come into a central location” to get the vaccine, CSIS’s Bliss said.

Chile’s national immunization registry also makes it easy to keep track of everyone’s vaccination status because everyone is on the same system. “You can easily know when a person has to get their doses, what vaccine was used,” Cuadrado said.

That also makes it easier for Chileans to get their second dose, and they can pretty much go wherever they’d like. “If you are, for example, on holiday or whatever, you can go just to the closest center that you find,” Cuadrado added.

Chile also had a pretty orderly rollout because its vaccination schedule is, well, a literal schedule. The campaign prioritized front-line health care workers, and then elderly people, starting at 90 or above and descending in age from there. Teachers and educators also got priority, as Chile’s school year began in March. Now, the country is vaccinating those with underlying vulnerabilities.

Each day of the week is assigned to a certain group. For example, on Wednesday, March 10, people who are 55 and 54 with underlying conditions or severe disabilities are eligible for the shot. On Thursday, it’s people between the ages of 53 and 50 with comorbidities, and so on from there. The calendar is set by the Ministry of Health and is the same for all Chileans, regardless of what municipality they’re in.

You don’t need to speak Spanish to see how simple and straightforward the schedule is:All people have to do is find the most convenient vaccination site in their region or community and go from there. Nobody has to make an appointment. Anyone who’s up for their second shot is also free to walk in wherever and get it.Crispi of the Universidad de Chile told me that experts, public health officials, and universities strove for a “common discourse” that clearly communicated to the public the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. Importantly, Crispi said, many of these people were outside of government, which is particularly unpopular in Chile.

“That was very important because of the skepticism that existed on the one hand toward the government, but also because the vaccines are new and we know there is a lot of [misinformation] going around about them,” Crispi said.

And as effective as Chile’s primary health care system has been in supporting the vaccination campaign, there are concerns about what that means for health care equity more broadly.

The pandemic, in general, has eclipsed regular health care services, and now the vaccination program might continue to do so, especially when it comes to things like child and maternal health, Tulane University’s Castro told me. “It’s like a double-edged sword,” she said. “[Chile’s] primary health care strategy is facilitating the rollout of the vaccines at the expense of essential services.”

This has also brought up bigger questions about equity. Chile’s divided health care system means those who have access to the private system tend to have a lot more privileges. But in the case of vaccinations, it’s the public health system that is the star.

This matters because last October, Chile announced that it would rewrite its constitution. In October 2019, a protest over a metro fare hike transformed into a broader fight over inequality in Chile, and that political momentum has now given Chile the chance to rewrite its laws.

Elections for those who will serve on this new Constitutional Committee are expected to be held in April, and the question is how the pandemic, and this vaccination campaign, might shape the candidates who are selected to reform Chile’s political system.

“I think there are some voices that are willing to learn from this pandemic and learn from the vaccination process, and to promote a health system that is more equitable, that unites us as a country,” Crispi said.

But that vaccination campaign itself, Crispi added, is still “a story that is to be written.”

It is the exact opposite of the morass of requirements and appointment systems in countries like the United States.

As Jon Andrus, a global vaccine expert at The George Washington University and former official at the Pan American Health Organization, put it: “Being able to have policy and a plan of action, a sheet of music that everybody’s reading from — that’s critical.”

Chile’s vaccination story is an early success. But it’s still early.
Chile has essentially met its initial goal of vaccinating 5 million people by the end of March. According to Daza, Chile’s vice minister for public health, almost 80 percent of people over 70 have already received at least one vaccine dose, and about 65 percent of those over 60 have gotten one.

But Chile is still in the early days of its campaign. Though the country has secured a lot of doses, it doesn’t yet have all its doses in hand for the entire population — though, again, Chile’s decision to try to get shots from many different places makes this a little less risky.

The country is also struggling to contain the Covid-19 pandemic; a little more than 20 percent of the population has gotten one shot, but new cases are now spiking to around 5,000 a day, some of the highest levels in months. Public health experts are desperately trying to balance the good news of vaccinations with attempting to convince the public of the continued need for masks and social distancing.

And though Chile may be the vaccination leader in Latin America, its neighbors’ comparatively slow and tiny vaccination campaigns mean controlling the pandemic will be even harder. “It’s a race against the variants right now,” Andrus said. Chile has donated some 40,000 doses of Sinovac — 20,000 each to Ecuador and Paraguay — to help in their vaccination efforts, but it is not even close to what’s needed on the continent.

Vaccine hesitancy is also a concern, though experts said they see Chile and its long tradition of robust vaccination programs as blunting the kind of skepticism seen in other parts of the world, and helping to overcome even initial concerns about new Covid-19 vaccines specifically. According to a recent survey, more than 72 percent of Chilean respondents said they would get the Covid-19 vaccine.

2022/0139,News,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2021/0309/Vaccine-diplomacy-Will-free-shipments-pay-off-for-India,"ndia, home to nearly 1.4 billion people, is in the midst of a massive, countrywide COVID-19 vaccine drive. But no sooner had New Delhi begun to administer vaccines to its own citizens, back in January, than it began sending millions of free doses around the world.

The neighboring Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan was the first to receive Vaccine Maitri (Vaccine Friendship) shipments of AstraZeneca vaccines, followed by Nepal, Bangladesh, the Maldives, Myanmar – and Dominica, where the Caribbean island’s prime minister himself helped unload boxes at the airport.

As of mid-February, just 10 countries had administered 75% of all vaccines, according to the United Nations, securing large supplies for themselves in what has been termed vaccine nationalism. One hundred and thirty countries, meanwhile, had not yet received a single dose – a trajectory the U.N. secretary-general called “wildly uneven and unfair.”

WHY WE WROTE THIS
Home to a massive vaccine industry, India sees an opportunity to expand its leadership among countries feeling left behind, as others stockpile for themselves. It may be generous, but it’s also a boost for New Delhi’s goals.

One, a global nonprofit that combats extreme poverty and preventable disease, has estimated that the United States is likely to have a surplus of 453 million doses even if it vaccinates 100% of its population.

Experts say India sees the power vacuum around vaccines as an opportunity for diplomacy and soft power, in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s bid to raise India’s international profile. Next door, Beijing has also pushed vaccine diplomacy, but India’s industry strength, which is producing vaccines faster than they are currently being distributed at home, may give it an edge.

“From the very beginning of the pandemic, the Indian government seemed to be projecting itself as a responsible global stakeholder ... as an important part of global governance and the global health scenario,” an image supported by India’s strength in the sector, says Harsh Pant, professor of international relations at King’s College, London.

As of late February, India had exported about 36 million doses of vaccine across the world, about 20% of them as grant assistance. Meanwhile, it has launched the second wave of its domestic campaign, aiming to vaccinate 300 million of its 1.3 billion people by mid-summer.


What China is – and isn’t – learning from military drills near Taiwan
Two giants
Even before the pandemic, India was a major pharmaceutical hub, and manufactured about half of all vaccines sold globally. Now, the privately-owned Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s biggest vaccine manufacturer, has been producing 2.4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine a day, more than it can distribute domestically.

SII vaccines make up a large contribution of the World Health Organization’s COVAX initiative, which aims to make vaccines accessible for lower- and middle-income countries. The first shipment under the initiative was sent from India to Ghana late last month.

India’s vaccine diplomacy isn’t surprising. It is in line with the Modi government’s strategic use of soft power to aid diplomacy and foreign policy. Since his election in 2014, Mr. Modi has successfully proposed an “International Day of Yoga” to the United Nations, visited 58 countries, and reached out to the Indian diaspora, especially in the United States.

Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta (center) visits the central vaccine depot in Kitengela town on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya, March 4, 2021. Around 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India arrived in the country on Wednesday as part of the COVAX initiative.
But India is not alone in dominating vaccine diplomacy. There’s also China, which long promised several southeast Asian and African countries its homegrown vaccines and has been sending its own shipments across the world. For years now, China has made large investments in countries in India’s neighborhood, like Nepal, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka, that India has been unable to match. At the same time, India’s ties with Nepal – bordered by both India and China – have seen a setback, and disputes continue over India and China’s ill-defined borders along the Himalayan regions.

“Competition between China and India is now a permanent feature of international politics,” says Jabin Jacob, an associate professor of international relations at Shiv Nadar University outside New Delhi. “There is certainly an element of competition between the two countries to show themselves as leaders in Asia.”

“Both countries see themselves as offering models of political and economic development distinct from the West, the Chinese more so than the Indians,” Professor Jacob says. But India sees itself as an alternative to both “Western democracy and Chinese authoritarianism,” he adds.

This time, India seems to have an advantage. The lack of transparency and efficacy data regarding China’s vaccines has made many abroad wary. Some countries, like Sri Lanka, have rejected the Chinese vaccine made by Sinopharm and purchased vaccines from India instead.

Professor Pant says he’s “skeptical” whether vaccine diplomacy can be a “game changer” for India’s relations in the region. “Smaller states in India’s neighborhood will always try to balance India against China over the long term, and that’s to their advantage,” he says. “But I think in the short term it certainly changes the perception of India being a bully.”

Risks at home
Some analysts argue vaccine diplomacy is a luxury that New Delhi is undertaking at the cost of its own citizens’ well-being. India has the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases globally, preceded only by the United States, and pandemic restrictions caused the economy to fall into a recession for the first time in nearly a quarter century. Meanwhile, India’s own vaccine drive has not been up to speed.New Delhi is taking “considerable political risk domestically” by sending so many vaccines abroad, says Oommen Kurian, head of public health initiatives at the Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation. But he argues that, as a large country with an underfunded health system, India’s rollout at home needed to be slow, and could not match the pace of production, at least initially.

India’s vaccine outreach coincides with months of negative press abroad, amid a historic farmer protest against three hastily enacted agricultural laws. One critic was Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who last December expressed concern over the use of force on protesters. His comments drew sharp reactions from India, where the Foreign Ministry called his remarks “ill-informed” and lodged a formal protest.But in February, as Canada faced shortages in supplies from Pfizer and Moderna, it reached out to India to request vaccines manufactured by SII. Mr. Modi tweeted about receiving a call from “my friend” Mr. Trudeau and assuring him that India would do its best to facilitate vaccines. Afterward, an Indian ministry spokesperson told reporters that the Canadian prime minister had “commended” India’s efforts to “choose the path of dialogue” with protesters. About 500,000 doses of the vaccine arrived in Canada last week.

In the big picture, though, “it’s important not to overplay the long-term effects of vaccine diplomacy,” Professor Jacob says. “Once the pandemic is past, more traditional factors of power are likely to return to center stage, which means India will still have a lot of catching up to do with the West and China.”",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2021/03/0309-CORONAVIRUS_CANADA.jpg?alias=standard_900x600nc,"March 9, 2021",The Christian Science Monitor.,Vaccine diplomacy: Will free shipments pay off for India?,

India always prides itself as a country that has been the voice of sanity in the comity of nations. Now, it is emerging as a country that is playing a leading role in the democratisation of access to Coronavirus medicines and vaccines in the midst of the worst pandemic in living memory. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often called India the “pharmacy of the world”, the nation’s role as one of the largest producers of vaccines globally came in for high praise from US President Joe Biden and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who termed our vaccine production capacity as the “best asset” that the world has today. This statement comes on the back of the fact that under its “Vaccine Maitri” initiative, India has played the role of the first responder in the neighbourhood. It has not only assisted more than 150 countries through urgent health and medical supplies, New Delhi has also pledged $15 million and 10 lakh vaccine doses to UN health workers under the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI), the Vaccine Alliance, and plans to supply one crore doses to Africa. It has also operationalised the COVID-19 Emergency Fund for its neighbours with an initial contribution of $10 million. Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives have received our COVID-19 vaccines under grant assistance in sync with India’s “Neighbourhood First” policy. Further expanding its “vaccine diplomacy”, India plans to gift the shots to Oman, 15 Caribbean Community countries, Nicaragua and the Pacific Island states. However, as it needs to look after its economic interests too, particularly as our own economy has been hit by the pandemic, India has begun commercial exports of COVID-19 vaccines and sent two million doses each to Brazil and Morocco. Contractual supplies are also being undertaken in a phased manner and New Delhi has said it will gradually supply to the COVAX facility of the WHO, a global initiative to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries, regardless of their income level.

This status as a mature and stable country that is capable of taking on a leadership role in the middle of a global health crisis comes at a time when two other nations in the neighbourhood have riled the world community. While China has been held responsible for the global Coronavirus outbreak and has also raised hackles because of its expansionist policies under Xi Jinping, Pakistan under Imran Khan is being increasingly seen as a failed State which crushes minorities, harbours terror groups and has turned the region into a powder keg. So, in playing a leading role in supplying the coveted Corona shots to the world for free and also commercially, India is not only showcasing its production capacity to the world and ensuring that the international community turns to it in the unfortunate event of a pandemic in future, New Delhi is signalling to the world that it is ready to play a leadership role in the region and, in the process, earning the goodwill of the international community that is just priceless.

2022/0141,Article,https://merics.org/en/short-analysis/chinas-vaccine-diplomacy-assumes-geopolitical-importance,"Xi Jinping has pledged that a Covid-19 vaccine from China would be made a “global public good.” The larger Belt and Road Initiative, framed as a necessary component of the world’s post-corona economic recovery, is still relevant, but it’s the Health Silk Road that takes pride of place in China’s Covid-era diplomacy. This article is the first piece in a series on China’s international health politics. See also the second post on China's Health Silkroad and the third post on China’s efforts to pursue global health leadership.

On tour and in-country, Chinese diplomats are demonstrating Beijing’s beneficence by promising countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America preferential access to a Chinese vaccine. 

Since Xi’s pledge in May, Beijing has added the words “at a fair and reasonable price” to its offer of a vaccine as global public good. As with everything else that Beijing promotes as a public good, including BRI projects, vaccine development will prioritize the interests of Chinese companies. Nevertheless, Beijing is better positioned than the US to assume global leadership in the march to vaccinate the world. 

Contrary to Washington, Beijing has pledged to share vaccines 
Unlike the US, China has joined COVAX – the vaccine partnership that aims to subsidize vaccine access for poorer countries and ensure equitable global distribution. Though Beijing must also find a balance between inoculating its 1.4 billion citizens and providing the vaccine as a “global public good,” China’s low caseload and manufacturing capacity mean it can afford to act more generously. And while it might be naïve to take Xi Jinping’s pledges at face value, Washington and Beijing have made very different statements on the issue of vaccine sharing. Instead of pledging access across developing countries, the US health secretary instead stressed that an American vaccine would only be shared once US needs have been met. 

Earlier this month China’s party-state news agency Xinhua reported that China’s fifth vaccine candidate has entered the final, third phase of clinical trials.  Due to a scarcity of homegrown coronavirus cases the Chinese vaccines are undergoing widespread third phase trials with partner institutions overseas, with at least 16 countries having signed up to trials so far.China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a subsidiary of Sinopharm that is testing two inactivated vaccines, is conducting third phase trials in Argentina, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Peru, and the UAE, where the crown prince himself volunteered for vaccination. Serbia was reported to have signed up to trials, but contradicting reports followed. Sinovac has enlisted Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Indonesia, Turkey, and the Phillipines, but trials in Bangladesh have faltered after a funding dispute. CanSino is or will be testing in Mexico, Pakistan, Russia, Saudia Arabia, and trials are pending approval in Chile. CanSino’s planned trial in Canada was scrapped in late August after Chinese officials allegedly held up shipments of the vaccine. Earlier this month it was reported that Uzbekistan is in negotiations with Sinopharm and has also offered to test a vaccine from Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical, which is on the cusp of beginning third phase trials.

Countries hosting trials worked out agreements with China to purchase vaccine doses 
Many of the countries hosting trials have also worked out agreements with their Chinese counterparts to purchase doses or manufacture the vaccine for local distribution – for instance, Indonesia will receive 50 million doses of concentrate from Sinovac for local production, while Turkey is set to purchase 20 million doses. In mid-September, the UAE even approved Sinopharm’s vaccine for emergency use, handing China the honor of being the first country to have a vaccine approved for use by a foreign country. Earlier this month Bahrain also approved Sinopharm’s vaccine for emergency use, and Indonesia is reported to be considering a similar decision regarding the late-stage Chinese vaccines. 

Whoever wins the vaccine race, distribution will be political 
If China becomes the first country to manufacture a safe and effective vaccine at scale, the achievement will carry symbolic weight, but the vaccine race may not have a clear-cut winner. After mixed results from CanSino trials in Indonesia and the great news on vaccine efficacy from Pfizer and Moderna, the narrative that China is winning the race has shifted. But a cost comparison between Pfizer’s new mRNA vaccine and more affordable Chinese alternatives suggests a more nuanced picture. Rich countries have been signing purchase agreements worth billions of dollars with Western vaccine producers, but China is still poised to supply the “developing world.” 

In any event, the application of a Chinese vaccine will take on wider geopolitical significance. China has already offered USD 1 billion in loans to Latin America and the Caribbean for vaccine access, while Sino-Indian rivalry has found a new focal point around vaccine provision in Bangladesh. In Brazil, Chinese vaccine diplomacy has pitted Trumpish President Jair Bolsonaro against the governor of São Paulo, who wishes to purchase 46 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine. 

Vaccine diplomacy is not without risks for Beijing. If China faces any of the same problems with its vaccines as it did with its faulty PPE, it could suffer serious reputational harm. Even if the vaccines perform well, unscrupulous Chinese individuals and companies might work in countries with poor institutional oversight to undermine the China brand. Beijing might also find itself exposed to an expectations gap between its rhetoric and what it can actually deliver. 

The geopolitics of vaccine diplomacy is itself a risky business. In Southeast Asia there is already concern over the strategic costs of access to a Chinese vaccine. It is likely that Western commentators will echo flawed “debt diplomacy” arguments in accusing China of creating situations of dependency among its neighbors.  

The Health Silk Road is will probably follow the Belt and Road in facing backlash and bumps along the way, but however it fares, we can expect the importance of “vaccine diplomacy” to overshadow that of Beijing’s former “mask diplomacy.”

At the time of publishing, the country has recorded over 12.3 million confirmed cases and more than 163,000 deaths. The BBC reports that India is facing a “severe, intensive” second wave of the pandemic. The situation in states like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Punjab has reached alarming proportions.

How Did India Combat COVID-19 in 2020?
Last year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a stringent lockdown that brought economic activity to a shuddering halt. This lockdown led to a dramatic contraction of India’s GDP by 23.9% in the April-June 2020 quarter. The economy recovered somewhat in later quarters, but it experienced a recession in the 2020-21 financial year for the first time in 25 years.

Arguably, the lockdown was a success in preventing a rapid spread of COVID-19 last year. In percentage terms, India did not do too badly. After all, it has nearly 1.4 billion people in contrast to the US population of 330 million. The daily new cases in India dramatically declined until recently when the second wave hit the country. Thanks to a young population and public health measures, India experienced a remarkably low mortality rate.

What’s Behind Chile’s Vaccination Success?

India has low per capita income and poor health care facilities. So, its achievement in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak has been hailed by many public health experts, including the World Health Organization (WHO). In January, India launched a massive vaccination program to fight the pandemic. This was possible because the country has a track record of mass vaccination and massive vaccine production.

Indian manufacturers supply more than 60% of the world’s vaccines against diseases like polio and measles. Early on, the country began mass production of two COVID-19 vaccines: Covishield and Covaxin. The Serum Institute of India (SII), which partnered with the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, had already produced and stocked approximately 70 million Covishield doses even before India granted emergency approval to their vaccine. 

On January 16, India launched an ambitious plan to vaccinate around 300 million people by June. The world’s largest vaccination program focused first on those with high vulnerability to the coronavirus. First on the list were health care workers. They were followed by those who were 65 years or older. This ensured that the vaccine was not monopolized by the richest sections of Indian society. 

As vaccinations have increased, the Modi government has eased restrictions in the country. Crowds have gathered at large weddings, sporting events and festival celebrations. The government lifted restrictions to stimulate economic activity. A poor country like India with a large population could not afford a lockdown for too long. However, the easing of restrictions has not only led to increased economic growth, but also rising cases of COVID-19 infections. India faces a tough balancing act between stimulating economic activity and curtailing a pandemic.

India’s Vaccine Diplomacy
During the pandemic, India has embarked on an ambitious foreign policy initiative. Modi announced the Vaccine Maitri initiative to supply COVID-19 vaccines to other nations only four days after India began domestic vaccinations. With the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, India has shipped approximately 61 million doses to 84 countries, which have included free batches. It has pledged 200 million doses for the WHO’s COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative to ensure vaccines for 92 low and middle-income countries.India began its vaccine diplomacy by distributing doses to its immediate neighbors: Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. The country has also exported vaccines to faraway places such as the Caribbean, where the likes of Barbados, Dominica and Jamaica have benefited from Indian aid. Leaders of countries such as Brazil and Antigua and Barbuda have publicly thanked Modi for his country’s generosity.

As per some foreign policy experts, India’s vaccine distribution is a diplomatic masterstroke. It helps the country gain goodwill and increase its soft power. It could lead to a more peaceful neighborhood. In the future, India might win much support, strengthen its claim to a permanent seat at the UN Security Council and emerge as a great world power.

Vaccine diplomacy might be giving a rare chance to counter China, which has launched the Belt and Road Initiative to increase its global footprint. For decades, China has backed Pakistan and, for the last few years, has increased its presence in Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal. With Chinese influence growing in India’s closest neighbors, the country has understandably become anxious.

In June 2020, Chinese and Indian troops engaged in a bloody hand-to-hand combat with many dying in the process. Since that clash, relations between India and China have been fraught. India has banned over 200 Chinese apps and restricted Chinese investment into the country. COVID-19 has given a unique opportunity to India — the “pharmacy of the world” — to compete with China. By shipping vaccines to low and middle-income countries, India is gaining influence at the Chinese expense whose vaccines have been questioned by Western media.

Rich countries have failed poorer ones because they have focused on domestic programs. Unlike India, the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom are focused completely on vaccinating their domestic populations. India’s generosity is unique and might lead to long-term gains.

Masterstroke or Distraction?
However, there is a counterargument that India has been premature in kicking off vaccine diplomacy. It did so before setting its own house in order. According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, as of April 2, India has administered nearly 69 million doses, fully inoculating only 9.6 million people. That is just 0.71% of its population. India’s focus should have been getting every one of its citizens vaccinated instead of basking in complimentary tweets from foreign leaders. Such goodwill might turn out to be very transient. 

Recently, India has slowed down its vaccine exports and speeded up its vaccination program. The government has now enrolled private hospitals in its vaccination drive, and everyone above the age of 45 is now eligible for the vaccine. Modi himself got vaccinated on March 1, boosting public faith in COVID-19 vaccines and increasing their uptake nearly four-fold. It seems that the government is paying attention to its critics.

Time will tell whether India’s vaccine diplomacy was a bold masterstroke or an unwise distraction. It reveals that there are no easy choices for any nation during a raging pandemic.",https://www.fairobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/India-COVID-19-news.jpg,1/16/2021,Fair Observer,Is India’s Vaccine Diplomacy a Good Idea?,
2022/0143,Article,https://takshashila.org.in/blogs/can-india-lead-global-health-diplomacy,"The conventional forum of global diplomacy tends to be dominated by the issues of trade and security. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the light the importance of health diplomacy. Health security cannot be limited to the engagement at national level. Today, global level engagement is needed more than ever, as the world grapples with the issues of newly emerging communicable diseases, climate change, pandemics, anti-microbial resistance, and threat of bioterrorism. One might think that it is only now, since the pandemic started, that India has started to engage at global level on matters related to health. However, India has had a long history of health diplomacy which is driven by its ever-growing pharmaceutical, health, and IT industries.

Since the time of independence, India has been providing development assistance to lower income countries, in whatever capacity it can. Given India’s economic situation back then, it used to receive more funds than it would donate to other countries. However, in recent years, India has been focusing more on moving from being a recipient of aid to being a provider of foreign assistance. In the early 2000s, India’s foreign development assistance was seen more as an “expression of soft power centred on South-South solidarity”. However, since 2014, China’s growing assertion in India’s neighbouring countries and Indian Ocean has pushed India to provide foreign assistance to strategically important countries, besides the immediate neighbourhood, such as Seychelles and Mauritius. In 2016-17, India’s financial assistance in health sector accounted for 5.27% of the total foreign assistance budget.

India has played a critical role in making medicines and vaccines available at low prices, to people of low income countries. As of 2019, India supplies nearly two-third of the world’s AIDS treatment drugs. In 1993, when anti-retroviral drugs costed thousands of dollars per patient, Mumbai-based pharmaceutical company Cipla began producing the same drugs at a cost of USD 350. A few years later, Cipla also started producing fixed-dose combinations of ARV drugs – a combination of three drugs which were manufactured by three separate pharmaceutical companies. This drove down the global prices of ARV drugs. Moreover, Cipla also played an instrumental role in fighting the Big Pharma against the intellectual property rules, which prevented access to ARV drugs.

According to WHO’s 2020 Global Vaccine Market report, five major vaccine manufacturers produce 60% of the global volume and three out of those five manufacturers are Indian companies – Serum Institute of India, Bharat Biotech, and Haffkine. During 1990s, when recombinant hepatitis B vaccines were available for USD 23 per dose, Hyderabad based Shantha Biotech developed a novel process for producing the same vaccine and the price today is less than USD 4. MenAfriVac which was developed specifically for Africa to treat Meningitis A, was a result of collaboration among SII, PATH, and WHO with funding from Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

India has a major role to play in providing telemedicine services in Africa. The Pan African e-networkwas envisioned by the then President APJ Abdul Kalam, when he addressed the inauguration of Pan African Parliament in 2004. The Government of India and the African Union work collaboratively on this project, with the Ministry of External Affairs being the designated nodal ministry. India’s super specialty hospitals are connected to 48 patient end locations/hospitals in Africa, which facilitates the provision of quality diagnostic and treatment services. Considering the progress in health outcomes and towards Sustainable Development Goals, the Government of India, in 2018, proposed to extendtechnical and financial assistance for five more years.

When the COVID-19 pandemic started, the Government of India sought to engage at regional and multilateral levels. It reinvigorated dialogue with SAARC countries and set up an emergency fund with an initial contribution of USD 10 million. India also pushed for a meeting with leaders of G20 countries.  It provided technical assistance to countries like Kuwait and Maldives, by sending Rapid Response Teams. Even though India’s vaccination drive against COVID-19 has just began, it has already supplied 15.6 million doses of vaccine to 17 countries. These include Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Afghanistan. Vaccines will soon be sent to Cambodia, Mongolia, and Pacific Island states.

The pandemic has presented an opportunity to India to earn goodwill of strategically important countries. India is on a higher footing as it is producing the vaccine which is already approved in the US and UK, and more importantly, its vaccine industry has already gained credibility in the past 40 years. It is in the best interests of India to identify countries that are strategically important and engage in a dialogue with them through providing aid or technical assistance as needed. For instance, Bangladesh was supposed to conduct clinical trials for vaccine developed by China-based Sinovac. However, Sinovac later asked Bangladesh to fund the trials which it was not ready to do. India stepped in and has already delivered 30 million doses under the tripartite agreement signed with the country. Africa-China relations have suffered in the recent times with China not delivering on its promise of supplying vaccines and Africans facing discrimination in China.

Although China has an edge over India, when it comes to producing Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, this is the time India can start developing domestic capabilities. It already has plans of setting up bulk drug parks. Besides APIs, India also needs to focus on getting more investment in R&D so that it encourages innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. The global engagement has to occur simultaneously with the improvement of India’s public health system. Improvement in health indicators will cement India’s credibility at international level.

Post pandemic, it is inevitable that health will take a key position in matters of international relations. It is the time that India maintains the momentum it has gained in health diplomacy. India has all the means to become the leader of health diplomacy in the global South, with its pharmaceutical and health industries that have the ability to provide drugs and medical treatments at lower prices and its IT industry which can facilitate health innovations.",,Feb 23,The Takshashila Institution,Can India Lead Global Health Diplomacy?,
2022/0144,Article,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1893516,"During the first coronavirus disease (COVID-19) lockdown in May last year, myself and colleagues from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) were invited to discuss effective approaches that would ensure the economic development of Russia in the context of the pandemic. This was at an international conference titled “Pandemic as a Motor of Transformation.”
My argument was that uncertainty about the consequences of COVID-19 raised questions about subsequent challenges, including the worldwide economic crisis and information wars, which would affect the formation of a new world order post-COVID-19. Similarly, Russia’s future role in the geopolitical arena remains decidedly open. Western experts have predicted a decrease in its role, either by noting that the increasingly important rivalry between China and the US has sidelined Moscow or by expecting a decrease in its geopolitical role due to its heavy dependence on China. Russian academics were more optimistic about the situation, highlighting the opportunities for Russia in the post-COVID-19 era. For example, Sergey Karaganov and Dmitry Suslov urged that “the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, which coincided with the pandemic that shook the world, should be used to launch new initiatives.”
As my contribution to the conference, I argued that these scholarly discussions hinge on a new understanding of COVID-19 diplomacy; namely one of putting greater emphasis on soft power strategies. This is in contrast to hard power (especially military power), which has in the past been the focus of discussions of Russian influence and strategy. I stated that cooperation with other states to achieve one global goal — containing the virus and overcoming the consequences of the pandemic — could create opportunities for Russia to establish new and crucial niche roles, such as becoming a global health power, thus increasing its status and influence. One notable COVID-19 diplomacy effort has been the development and distribution of vaccines.
One year on from this discussion and Russia’s policymakers do indeed appear to have chosen such a soft power strategy. Moscow has now registered four different vaccines: Sputnik V and EpiVacCorona in 2020 and CoviVak and Sputnik Light this year. Sputnik V has emerged as an effective soft power tool. It is now authorized in 67 countries that have a combined population of more than 3.5 billion.
According to a statement by the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, which centralizes the production of Sputnik V, will make more than 1.1 billion doses of the vaccine available worldwide — enough for almost 550 million people. And the RDIF has already concluded several agreements with other countries (including China, India, Brazil, Argentina, Italy, Serbia, Belarus, Egypt, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Turkey and Bahrain) to produce the vaccine. Discussions with other countries are also ongoing (this list includes Mexico, Venezuela, Sweden, Germany, France, Spain, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bangladesh and Armenia).
Through these initiatives, Russia increases its geopolitical leverage. It is no coincidence that the name Sputnik was chosen, echoing that of the first man-made satellite in orbit, which was a key aspect of the Soviet Union’s soft power agenda in the 20th century. However, such advances are balanced by the use of hard power, which results in deteriorating relations with certain powers, the EU in particular.
Russia’s military action over Ukraine has been particularly controversial. Moreover, concerns about cybersecurity have been dividing Europe over any reliance on Russian vaccines. For example, Sputnik V has been approved or is being assessed for approval in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, which are prioritizing their national interests. Germany, among others, is at least prepared to consider it. However, French Minister of State for European Affairs Clement Beaune urged EU countries not to use the Russian or Chinese COVID-19 vaccines unless they are approved by the bloc’s medicines regulator, warning of a risk to the bloc’s unity and public health. The recent incident between Russia and the UK over warships in the Black Sea only adds to the worsening relations with European partners, limiting Russia’s vaccine diplomacy.

Sputnik V has been authorized in 67 countries that have a combined population of more than 3.5 billion.

What should we expect now? Russia will certainly continue its vaccine diplomacy, which has proved a successful tool worldwide. However, realistically it will be mainly successful among Russia-friendly governments, which accept its geopolitical role. By contrast, since soft power strategies can be badly damaged by hard power/military strategies, Russia’s soft power will be less effective among geopolitical competitors and where Moscow is seen as a threat. There are trade-offs between hard and soft power strategies and they are often incompatible. Russia will continue to balance both approaches’ respective applications, selectively presenting itself as a military power or a global health collaborator.",https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/n_670_395/public/main-image/opinion/2021/07/13/r3puvtwzdzj3hfxm6tcr4z5llu.jpg?itok=N4UPB56L,"Mar. 29, 2021",arab news,Vaccine diplomacy sees Russia boost its geopolitical leverage,

Nobody knows what the future will hold and how long the graded lockdown will last or whether the country will experience a further wave and be back to complete lockdown once again. The only certain thing is that nothing is certain, but the lockdown has been an eye-opener. During this period, one of the facets that I noticed was the gradual enabling of India’s soft power.

Be it performing arts, music, Ayurveda, cuisine, diaspora, democracy, public diplomacy or even the civilisational gesture of ‘namaskar’ and ‘vanakkam’, the country has had a wide range of mediums to enable its cultural imprint, and these are seeing widespread resonance, acceptance and organic practice.

‘Namaskar’ and ‘vanakkam’ have come into sudden fashion in times of physical distancing, while fighting this epidemic. It is an old civilisational greeting from India, which means that I, as an individual, salute the sacred and the divine in you. It is so much more meaningful than a mere ‘hi’ or ‘hello’. In the recent past, we saw how this simple Indian greeting transcended Indian boundaries when pictures and videos of Prince Charles from the United Kingdom were flashed, as he greeted people with the same gesture at a public function.

Only a few days ago, one of India’s popular diplomats, Syed Akbaruddin, retired from his post of India’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations. During his tenure, he reinforced India's pragmatic importance in the United Nations and also told the world about India’s contribution to human rights, through Hansa Mehta. In his farewell message, he was seen telling the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that he had a small request before leaving, in a virtual call between the two. He said, “In the Indian tradition, when we leave or when we meet, we do not say ‘hello’ or shake hands, but we say 'namaste'. So before I end, I want to say namaste to you and I hope you can reciprocate.” This gesture was warmly reciprocated by the UN Secretary-General.

In the case of performing arts and music, India is witnessing a number of civic initiatives to help its citizens deal with the pandemic. One such specific initiative, which is aimed at the youth, is the Youth Alliance Against Corona (YAAC). YAAC was formed as an independent network of organisations, spearheaded by the youth across the country. The network’s activities include helping migrant workers in various states in India, feeding the needy through donating groceries and ration, and organising interactive virtual sessions for the benefit of the youth in such testing times. The network organised a live Facebook session with acclaimed playback singer Mohit Chauhan, as part of a host of other sessions. His 40-minute Facebook live session, that is still available on his page, has had over 2,00,000 views. The session saw Chauhan sing a Nepali song on request from followers from Nepal.

In addition to Nepal, the session saw participants from Bangladesh and Maldives, to name a few countries in India’s neighbourhood. The organic response to his messages during the session and his songs that cut across boundaries, truly pay credit to the singer and to the galaxy of Indian musicians who remain in the hearts and minds of the people abroad.

On the occasion of World Dance Day on April 29, several classical dancers stepped up their creative efforts to showcase how to fight the spread of Covid-19 through some out-of-the-box ideas. These dancers used their medium to tell the plight of labourers and migrant workers. Some of the expositions that have garnered a lot of views on YouTube have also depicted how one must be compassionate in such times.On the cuisine front, social media lit up when the New York Times, in an op-ed on April 28, carried ‘rajma chawal’ (curried kidney beans and rice) as the ‘indisputable king of bean dishes’, going on to explain why it is the best kind of comfort food right now in the times of Covid-19. In addition to this, chef superstars like Vikas Khanna in the US are also enabling and leading relief efforts in their unique capacities, by constantly taking requests from social-media users and ensuring help reaches them.

April 9 marked the founding day of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). As part of its initiatives during the lockdown, the organisation, which is the cultural diplomacy arm of the Ministry of External Affairs, announced interesting and innovative e-classes in various fields of soft power, including education, performing arts, language and yoga. In addition to this, the ICCR also announced a global painting competition as well as an essay-writing competition for NRI students and alumni of Indian institutions.

The diaspora too is an integral part of the country’s soft-power story. Indiaspora, a group of Indian entrepreneurs in the US, has donated close to US$ 800,000 (and counting) for food security programmes in both India and the United States, which was part of a campaign titled, ’Chalo Give for Covid-19’. As part of the initiative, they have also successfully fed close to six million people in both countries thus far.

Interestingly, the American Physicians of Indian-Origin (AAPI) body said that every seventh doctor in the US is an Indian and they are at the frontlines. Famous Indian actor Adil Hussain put out a video of an Indian-origin doctor, Dr Uma Madhusudhan from Karnataka, being applauded for her extraordinary service at the South Windsor Hospital in the US.

The Indian movie world was jolted with the back-to-back deaths of Irrfan and Rishi Kapoor during the lockdown, but the cherished memories that were shared by the cinema fraternity across the globe were discernible. For instance, there were more than 42 million views and thousands of discussion threads on the Chinese social media platform Weibo after Irrfan passed away. A cursory view of some tributes to both actors will also showcase how they were called by their first names in global cities like New York, for the characters they portrayed on the silver screen.Dr PLT Girija, the founder of Sanjeevani Ayurveda Foundation based in Chennai — in a paper titled ‘Ayurveda for revitalising Healthcare in India’ — has written that the World Health Organization (WHO) report on Traditional Medicine Strategy 2002-2025, noted that for 65 per cent for the Indian population, Ayurvedic medicine is the “only available source of healthcare”. True to this, for the first time in the history of the Indian government, Ayurveda treatment was approved as part of clinical trials for Covid-19 victims.

In the lockdown period, the YAAC also organised a dedicated Facebook live session with Rajiv Vasudevan, the founder and CEO of AyurVAID Hospitals, who spoke about ‘Building Immunity in the Times of Covid-19: The Ayurveda Perspective’. The session saw viewers from Latin American countries such as Peru, European countries such as France, and Southeast Asian countries such as Singapore.

Finally, democracy. The organic response of adhering to the national lockdown across the country in these many days has been heartening. In a country as big as India, it is not easy to solicit such a response. While the fight continues, the value and commitment to not put lives at risk, and to ensure that the guidelines stipulated by the governments in the Centre and the states, speak volumes of the resolve of the people. There has also been a positive response to the hundreds of social organisations that are doing their very best for the country.

When India’s exceptionalism is defined and takes shape in the 21st century, I am certain that some of these important aspects of our civilisational ethos will be its vital cog. For all we know, armies may not win the next big war if there is one. The next big thing that countries will have to offer will be the true stories of the real aspects of life, aspects that form the very fabric of society and culture. Purely in terms of this, India is very well placed in the pursuit of her ‘Great Indian Dream’.",,"May 07, 2020",dailyo,The rise of India's soft power in Corona times,
2022/0146,Article,https://dailyasianage.com/news/240530/vaccine-diplomacy-why-its-important-for-bangladesh,"As many countries and companies are racing to develop vaccines to stop the COVID-19 pandemic, experts said Bangladesh needs to make 'vaccine diplomacy' a part of its strategy to get one fast once it is ready.

In the context of polarised world politics, they said, Bangladesh should deal with both China and India smartly with an 'open to all policy' alongside maintaining the contact with all the potential vaccine-producing countries to be among the first to procure an effective vaccine, reports UNB.

The experts, however, think it will still be too premature to make any final procurement deal with any potential vaccine-producing country right now since it is not clear which vaccine may prove safe and effective on completion of its phase-III trial.

Contacted, Prof Dr Delwar Hossain of Dhaka University's International Relations department said Bangladesh seems lagging behind in corona vaccine diplomacy for lack of proper planning, strategy and initiative. ""We need smart diplomacy with proper planning and strategy to have enough doses of corona vaccine from the successful candidate in due time,"" he said.

The DU professor said it will be difficult to have a vaccine only relying on bilateral relations with a few countries as internal politics and political economy are involved with it. ""Economic diplomacy is also very important here. Having a large size of population, Bangladesh is surely a big market for the vaccine producers which can be used as a bargaining tool during the negotiation,"" he pointed out.

Delwar said two friendly countries -- China and India -- have already assured Bangladesh of giving priority in providing their vaccines due to their geopolitical interests. ""We've already accepted China's offer for the trial of its vaccine. We should also positively respond to India's proposal. We should also look for options to join the trial of other vaccine candidates to create a scope to get it on a priority basis.""

He, however, doubted about getting enough doses of any vaccine from sources like China and India as these countries have huge internal demand due to their very big population size. ""So, we should keep it in mind the vaccine diplomacy. We need to focus on getting permission for manufacturing any vaccine in our country to ensure its availability here in due time.""

Since it is not sure which vaccine will finally come out as an effective one, Delwar said Bangladesh should maintain contract with all the potential vaccine-producing countries and reach an understanding for getting their vaccines once those are approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). ""We must carefully monitor the development around the world regarding vaccines.

We should have diversified sources. We'll have to keep all the channels open. We'll remain open to all. But before striking any written deal, we must remain very alert so that our money is not wasted and our national interest is not harmed in any way,"" he advised.

As a developing country, Delwarsaid, Bangladesh should also make stronger efforts to have a vaccine with the help of Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (Gavi), UNICEF, WHO, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), PAHO, World Bank, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and others.

Prof Muzaherul Huq, former adviser to WHO South-East Asia region, said China, India, the UK, the USA and Russia are now the most potential vaccine-producing countries. ""We should keep in touch with them all.""

Besides, he said, the government needs to have constant contact with Gavi or international bodies to have promised vaccine doses from them on the principle of equitable distribution.

Contacted, Health Minister Zahid Maleque said the government has been working actively and sincerely to get an effective vaccine when it will be available. ""We're contacting multiple sources instead of depending on any particular one to have the sufficient doses of a vaccine at the right time.""

He said Bangladesh sent an application to Gavi in July last through the WHO to avail of COVAX Global Vaccines Facility for lower- and middle-income countries. ""Our application has been accepted.""

Besides, he said, they have already allowed the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) to run phase-III trial of China's Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine in Bangladesh. ""The trial of Sinovac's vaccine will begin within a few days.Initially, the trial will be conducted on volunteers, mainly doctors and nurses of six-seven hospitals. ""

As we're participating in the trial, we'll get one lakh free doses of the vaccine primarily, and then we'll get priority in procuring the vaccine. This vaccine can be available by January next,"" the minister said. He said Beximco Pharma signed a deal with India's Serum Institute to get priority access to the COVID-19 vaccines being developed by it.

Serum Institute has already partnered with Oxford/AstraZeneca along with Bill  and  Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi to produce more than a billion doses of the vaccine for global supply. ""We hope Beximco Pharma will privately get a good number of vaccine doses from India,"" Zahid said. He said they also officially sought vaccine cooperation from India and they got assurance in this regard. The minister said they sent a letter to Russia to get its vaccine and the country gave a positive response. ""

The Russian government wants to go under a government-to-government process fixing the rate of the vaccine. They also may allow us to produce their vaccines in Bangladesh."" He said a letter was also sent to US drug-maker Pfizer for having its vaccine when it will be available. ""We hope they'll give us the vaccine timely.""

About Oxford's vaccine, Zahid said they will get it through India since the country has a partnership with AstraZeneca. ""So, we won't lag behind in providing vaccines to our people. We're trying to get it from five to six sources. We're even ready to procure necessary doses of vaccines, but we want an effective and harmless one at a fair price.""

He, however, said India has not yet come up with any offer to conduct the trial of their any vaccine in Bangladesh. ""If we get any such proposal, we'll decide it then. Earlier, Foreign Secretary Masud bin Momen said Dhaka intended to pick one potential vaccine that would be safer and most useful for Bangladesh while ""our efforts are on to get access to a potential Covid vaccine."" ""It (vaccine) could be from China, Russia, the USA or India . . . our discussion is underway with them all,"" he added.

2022/0147,Article,https://cabar.asia/en/vaccine-diplomacy-in-central-asia-geopolitics-business-and-soft-power,"An international online meeting under the auspices of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) in Central Asia and the Oxus Society for Central Asia Affairs has helped to shed light on “Vaccine Diplomacy, Regionalism and Geopolitical Influence in Central Asia”.Central Asia remains a special geopolitical space, where vaccine diplomacy from Russia, China, Western countries is projected during the pandemic period, while simultaneously trying to establish production within the region. The intertwinement of different geopolitical emphases in vaccine diplomacy influences several clusters in the region.

The choice of the main partner in the field of vaccination in Central Asia will affect not only geopolitics but is also shaped by domestic political and economic factors. An international online meeting under the auspices of the Institute for War and Peace Reporting (IWPR) in Central Asia and the Oxus Society for Central Asia Affairs has helped to shed light on “Vaccine Diplomacy, Regionalism and Geopolitical Influence in Central Asia”.

The essence and rationale of vaccine diplomacy

Alexander Cooley, Director at Harriman Institute, Columbia University, believes that vaccine diplomacy is becoming the geopolitical tool, the geopolitical weapon in the battle for global influence:“Russia, China, India are among the emerging countries, the diminishing influence of the west and the liberal international order – this is the typical headline”. The article by Lionel Laurant in Bloomberg: “Russia and China are beating the West at vaccine diplomacy” outlines that Russia and China are deploying vaccines strategically around the world and beating out the West in vaccine diplomacy. It gives us the sense that vaccine diplomacy, COVID-19 jabs are the instruments of influence.”

Professor Cooley also highlighted the factors influencing vaccine diplomacy on international relations: “The first is the tension between vaccine nationalism and inequality, and whether the system of global governance and cooperation, that we have, can solve it effectively. Second, perceptions of competence in dealing with COVID-19 within their own countries and vaccine administration. Third, the specific issue of providing selective and public goods to other countries, including vaccines.

The first is simply that we have a situation where vaccine nationalism, that is rich countries ordering vaccines and taking for themselves, are going to leave poor countries behind. There was a controversial map put by the Economist that shows that according to their estimates many countries in the developing world are not going to receive vaccine until late 2022-2023.The problem is that rich countries, like Canada, the United States, the UK, the EU preordered a bunch of vaccines, multiple times the doses needed for their population size. As a result, the international community has put together the COVAX program that is led by WHO and GAVI (the vaccine alliance). The idea here is to pool the procurement and deliver 2 billion doses of vaccines to poor countries by the end of 2021. 183 countries joined the COVAX, including China, Japan and EU. The U.S. and Russia initially ruled out joining, the U.S. has joined since the Biden administration, Russia indicated to participate in a small way.

The problem is that deliveries are very slow from COVAX. The Health Minister of Kyrgyzstan last month said that the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine doses for Kyrgyzstan would not be allocated. Why? Because it had to be stored at a very low temperature. The refrigerator cost would be prohibitively high and they do not have funds in the budget. This story encapsulates the inequality in the vaccine system but also that the global governance is unresponsive to the needs of the countries like Kyrgyzstan, taking steps unilaterally, and not having their ear on the ground to have appropriate local solution.”

Soft power and the image of states

Experts are unambiguous in their opinion that vaccine supply has an impact on the image of countries and is also associated with the implementation of soft power. Professor of political science at Virginia Commonwealth University Judyth Twigg believes that Russia’s promotion of the vaccine is a symbol of retaining great power status, pride, respect:

“In terms of vaccine diplomacy Russia was clearly the first country in the world out of the gate. Sputnik V (V stands for ‘Victory’) was the first to be approved by the national government back in August, 2020 and that approval came with a great fanfare. The fact that the vaccine website was set in seven languages tells us about the intended audience for Sputnik V. It was not just domestic but the global audience that they were aiming for.Sputnik V is now registered in more than 40 countries; it is hard to keep up because number of countries increases every day. There has been a special interest in Latin American countries and within European Union. European medicine agency is beginning the formal review of Sputnik V, and it is likely to be officially approved by the EU soon. The vaccine was confirmed last month safe and highly effective in the peer-reviewed publication in the Lancet, one of the world’s leading medical journals. Sputnik has been rolled out across Russia. It is very easy to get vaccinated in Moscow. There is wide availability in clinics across country. In fact, if you go to GUM, the luxury department store at the Red Square, you can get a free ice cream along with your jab. In Moscow and in another parts of Russia, it appears that supply of Sputnik V outstrips demand. It looks like there is a substantial vaccine hesitance in Russia. There are many COVID deniers in Russia, many people who are anti-vaccine in general, and many people who do not trust, specifically, the Sputnik V vaccine in Russia.

Internationally, in terms of exercising soft power through provision of vaccine, Russia was aggressively marketing Sputnik V well before any of the western vaccines had regulatory approval. Many countries have now more deals to receive sputnik doses that had been manufactured somewhere else especially in India, and there are many other countries that receive technology and formula from Russia so that they can make the vaccine themselves.

Russia has three goals: Sputnik V is obviously the symbol of retaining great power status, pride, respect. To be the first in the way out of the once in a century global pandemic puts Russia on a map as a great scientific and technological power. Russia portrays itself in that way deliberately.

For instance, when the Sputnik V website was first launched, it took few seconds for the website to load, there was a built-in delay and you were encouraged to push a button on the screen. You got the audio from the broadcast in space referring back to 1957 when the first sputnik satellite was launched. It was the hallmark of the superiority of Russia in the space race, and it is no accident that they evoke that moment now even using the name Sputnik for the vaccine.

Secondly, clearly Russia wants to exercise soft power. Poor and middle-income countries are desperate about access to vaccine.

Russia realizes that there is a diplomatic hope to appear as savior during this unprecedented global crisis.
In particular, Russia is contrasting its own generosity against the perceived selfishness of the United States, Canada, UK that have gobbled up all of the available doses of Pfizer, Moderna and some of the other European vaccines through pre-purchase agreements leaving the rest of the world with nothing. This has happened before with anti-HIV medications. Russia is very anxious to highlight these historical inequities.”

Professor Cooley also adds that how countries manage the epidemic is a form of soft power, it is a form of their soft power, quality of their authority: “Initially, over the summer, we saw very bad marks to the U.S., quite good marks to the EU, bad also quite marks for China. That is just some data from the Pew Research Center on global attitudes towards global leadership and the pandemic. Both China and US have been perceived as doing a bad job in handling the pandemic.

We now moved to a new metric, and it is who can deliverer vaccine doses effectively. Perceptions of how countries are managing the pandemic are very fluid and I think we are going to remember the last metric as opposed to the summer metric. In this area, the positions of the summer are reversed: the UK and the US are effectively and quickly vaccinating their own populations, while the EU is lagging significantly. This is likely to change the interpretation of which countries best managed the pandemic, despite the significant loss of life in the United States.”

Economic and political motives

Vaccine diplomacy in a number of countries is not limited to image intentions, but naturally pursues economic goals. As noted by expert Judyth Twigg, Russia sees Sputnik V as a business opportunity: “Russia wants to maximize market share. They offer Sputnik V for 20 dollars for two doses, quite cheaper than Pfizer and Moderna. There is a longer term set of business interests. Russia has not traditionally been much of the player in pharmaceutical market. So, there is a lot Russia would like to achieve.

Russia needs Central Asia vaccinated since it needs migrant labor from CA to return to Russia that drive Russian economy. There are also political motives. Russia is clearly making it to counter-play the Chinese influence in the region. It has traditionally been Russia’s own backyard. Russia has sold other pharmaceutical products in recent decades in Central Asia.

However, there are caveats about whether Russia is achieving or is likely to achieve its goals. The way Russia has proceeded has not inspired confidence. There is a correct perception that development was rushed, that Sputnik V did not go through the full scientific and regulatory vetting since there was a lot of top-down political pressure to be first in the vaccine race.”

Professor Cooley also believes that “in China vaccine diplomacy is another good on offer within these BRI and Health Silk Route cooperation bundles. It is usually bundled with other goods, private and club goods. And, for Russia, the development of Sputnik – you can see them targeting areas that the West has not reached, the countries that are ambivalent in being part of the liberal international order. It is not cheaper, even though they claim that it is. But the vaccine is intended to enhance Russia’s international prestige and may be used as a diplomatic leaver, for example included within the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union agenda.An expert on China and Central Asia, Temur Umarov also reveals the political motives behind Chinese vaccine diplomacy: “China uses all its vaccine producing capacity to roll out its vaccine diplomacy campaign and hear Chinese vaccines have several advantages to Western alternatives. For example, they do not require extra cold storage, which makes distribution a little bit easier. The one registered dose vaccine is also an attractive competitor. That is why, some of the countries are preferring to go to China to get vaccines.

We have seen in the past months that China has been one of the leading countries to export its vaccines. China is very successful in its vaccine diplomacy. But, there are many questions whether China is willing to help other countries or is it another political instrument that China would use to boost its reputation across the world. There are questions about the quality of Chinese vaccines.”

Multivectorism as an axiom for the region

Professor Cooley substantiates the importance of multivector diplomacy in the period of vaccine diplomacy: “We all know, that CA countries practice multi vector diplomacy. But, when it comes to vaccines, every competent country should practice multivector diplomacy since you do not want to rely on any one supplier that would allow complete political leverage over you. Multivectorism when it comes to vaccines should be axiomatic.

Two, certain political elites and parties usually disposed favorably to multipolar politics, signaling that they intend to cooperate with Russia or China, are using vaccine diplomacy in that surface. Vaccine diplomacy: it is real, it is another tool, it is very high profile, and in some cases, contracts are big.”

Judyth Twigg believes that although all five CA countries have registered Sputnik V or are talking with Russia, but none counting exclusively on Russia: “especially Kazakhstan, which started mass vaccination on February 1 using Sputnik V, but Kazakhstan was also the first country in the world, a couple of weeks ago, to announce that it will start local production of Sputnik V and, importantly, that is in addition to Kazakhstan’s own COVID vaccine.

There are also other donors in Central Asia, especially the multilateral development banks. The Asian Development Bank announced 9 billion USD initiative and the World Bank – 12 billion USD effort. Some of it is going through COVAX, some is going to support the bilateral arrangements, and much of it is going to support logistical hurdles and administrative capacity. None of these multilateral development banks’ money is going towards Sputnik V.”

Temur Umarov also mentioned that Central Asia prefers to cooperate cautiously with China on vaccine diplomacy: “Although China has started its talks with governments of Central Asia about the trials in 2020, and it had three producers. It has conducted negotiations about trials with Uzbekistan that is the only and most open to Chinese COVID diplomacy. On the one hand, it is understandable that within the Central Asian society, Uzbekistan is less skeptical of Chinese products as a whole. Now we see that Russia is leading the battle over the Central Asian vaccine diplomacy and all other Central Asian states have negotiated with Russia to get Sputnik V. One of the surveys proves that the majority of CA populations considers Russia to provide the best solution in terms of vaccine, less than a 10 percent supports China. The reason is that, all Central Asian societies are skeptical about the quality of the Chinese goods. The Chinese policy in Xingjiang region, has also an impact on Central Asia.”

Summarizing

Independent analyst Parviz Mullojanov concludes that “there are three factors, that affect the final decisions of the Central Asian governments. First, the external or geopolitical group of factors. This is the choice between Russia, China and Europe, who are major geopolitical actors in the region. In that sense, it is not the choice of the major vaccine but of the partner country.


Parviz Mullojanov
The geopolitical aspects are perceived by the both sides, for the external players it means the prestige, and instrument of future influence that would strengthen their position in the country. This is the opportunity for the country to enter pharmaceutical market.  It is also, a security issue. You cannot stop corona on the borders. There is pressure from the countries we cooperate with, most of the people are coming from those countries. Hence, it is urgent to ensure that there is no corona. It can be also an attempt for future cooperation, like for Tajikistan to join the Eurasian Economic Union. It is a field of trade-offs.

The second cluster includes economic factors, the cost of vaccine delivery and its maintenance. There is also, an issue over the vaccination passports, that are widely discussed in the local media and social networks. It would basically provide clearance for traveling. There is less trust to Chinese providers among the local populations, therefore, the governments have to take it into account.”

Expert Judyth Twigg summed up that “most important perspective, taking the step back, is that we just need as many good vaccines as we can, and as quickly as we can deploy them, no matter where they come from. In that sense, it is somewhat unfortunate that the tenor of the conversation is so much about the competition, rather than collaboration, and Russia makes this statement all the time.  But this is a little disingenuous, since Russia is making this statement at the exact same time as it is proclaiming the superiority of its own and engaging in little bit of disinformation about the Western alternatives. Central Asia is clearly emerging as one of the most important arenas for this diplomatic competition.”

India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh’s Sheikh Hasina met in a virtual summit Thursday -- the first high-level meeting of the leaders from the two countries since relations nosedived when India passed its controversial religion-based citizenship law late last year.

""India and Bangladesh are cooperating well on the Covid vaccine,” Modi said at the summit’s inauguration, adding that New Delhi ""will pay special attention” to Bangladesh’s immunization requirements.

Hasina said the two countries can move up global value chains by further integrating their economies. She also announced the inauguration of the Chilahati-Haldibari trans-border railway link between the countries that had stopped functioning in 1965.

Last December Bangladesh’s foreign minister AK Abdul Momen and home minister Asaduzzaman Khan had both called off visits after nationwide protests erupted in India against its new citizen law. The new law fast-tracks Indian citizenship for non-Muslims from three neighboring nations including Bangladesh.

New Delhi has since been making overtures to smoothen relations with Dhaka, with whom it has a long history of cooperative ties.

Indian foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla visited Bangladesh twice this year. The second visit in August came amid rising border tensions with China, which has committed $40 billion in investments in Bangladesh.

On Thursday the two countries signed seven agreements relating to trade, energy and agriculture. Annual trade between India and Bangladesh stood at $10.25 billion in the fiscal year ended March 2019, Indian government data shows.

Dhaka was also expected to raise the issue of management of trans-boundary rivers including the long-pending water sharing agreement for river Teesta. India’s foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and his counterpart Momen had in September noted their commitment to finalizing an interim deal in a dispute that has lingered since the 1980s without any resolution.

The ""long-drawn failure to sign the Teesta river water agreement” and the new citizenship law have together ""unsettled public opinion in Bangladesh” against New Delhi despite decades of close ties, said Delwar Hossain, a professor of international relations at Dhaka University. ""Now Covid-19 has brought the two nations together once again.”

2022/0150,Article,https://diplomatist.com/2020/03/31/bangladesh-corona-crisis-and-governmental-crisis-management-initiatives/,"The entire world has been facing a war against the novel coronavirus. The WHO has recently announced COVID-19 as a global epidemic. Bangladesh confirmed its first three cases of COVID-19 on 8th March 2020 by Institute of Epidemiology, Diseases Control and Research (IEDCR). About 1,310 persons have been tested where 49 have been confirmed positive, 5 of them have died and 19 patients have recovered among them till 30th March.

On 25th March, 2020 the Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina gave a speech considering the welfare of the nation. 26th March is the Independence Day of Bangladesh. PM announced to celebrate the day differently by staying at home and helping the government to save the country. The PM had stated, “I know, our country people are spending their days in a type of depression and fear, but we need to face the crisis situation with patience and bravery.” She also requested returned migrants to maintain the rules of ‘home quarantine’ and save everyone here. She assured that importance will be given to the health workers. She advised television media and social media to preach public awareness news and not to spread any fake news as the government will take strict measures towards fake news spreaders. She said, “If any troubled people want, they can take shelter in Bhasan Char which has been prepared for re-habitation of 1 lakh Rohingya population”.

Our government has taken many initiatives to handle the current crisis. From 17th March educational institutions have been closed for ensuring the safety of students and their families. In order to continue the school education of the children, the government has arranged to take classes through Shongshod Bangladesh Television. Ten days undeclared lockdown has been continuing which started from 26th March and will be continued till 4th April. Only daily necessary goods, medicines and hospitals are available. All internal public transportation services are also closed. From 24th March our army has been assisting district administration to maintain social distancing and increasing consciousness among general people in 61 districts.

Returned migrants are under strict control to follow home quarantine. And now Armed Forces (Army, Navy and Air Force) patrol are helping administration curb transmission. Non-state actors like various commercial and volunteer organizations are helping country people and health workers and cooperating with the government. Different governmental organizations are cleaning city roads and lanes with germicides. A non-government garments industry, Smart Jacket Ltd. has been preparing 1 lakh Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) in order to protect doctors and health workers.

The banking sector has been continuing its services limitedly. The time limitation of import money and export goods repatriation has been extended to six months. The government has announced a $58,823.53 package for export-dependent industries in order to ensure giving their workers payments. Water, gas and electricity supply services’ bills can be paid without fine till June.

The opposition leader Begum Khaleda Jia’s punishment has been suspended because of the COVID-19 crisis and she is in-home quarantine. And the opposition political party has demanded to the realisation of an emergency medical situation and to suspend all electoral activities for at least six months. They also recommended to the government to take immediate actions in order to socio-economic crisis management.

President of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), Rubana Hoque has addressed the miserable condition of the garment’s purchase order and requested international buyers to help them by not dismissing their orders. She assured 12 lakhs workers that they will be given their payments, all of whom are living in uncertainty about livelihood. Another cloth exporting institution, Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) members have also expressed their fear of future uncertainty. The purchase order of $1.48 billion has been cancelled by buyers from different countries.

The government is working to control the epidemic, but it is a matter of sorrow that our country has to face the global corona crisis without pre-initiatives to handle it. And it is after a few days of first corona confirmation in Bangladesh when the government has taken some major measures regarding COVID-19 issue. In the first scenario, we have felt a lack of medical facilities suited for the treatment of corona patients. But then our Asian neighbours have helped us to manage the problem.

Information Ministry and Health Ministry announced two communique which seems unsuitable to the non-governmental television channel operators and BCS Health Cadre Association and the ministries have cancelled the communique. The BCS Health Cadre Association recommended the governmental organs not to stay apart and not to do hurry but to take initiatives through negotiation and cooperation as we all have to secure the fighting spirit of the nation in order to manage the universal crisis. 285 Bangali migrants returned only within two days of March 14 to 15 especially from Italy and Saudi Arabia. And 75 percent of the returnees have not maintained home quarantine. This is the major reason why Bangladesh is facing ‘community transmission’. Till 25th March more than 1 crore people have left Dhaka and caused a large scale internal movement as there has been announced a 10 days’ general vacation.

The Chinese government and non-governmental organizations have been assisting us by supplying every type of medical equipment. India has also assisted us according to their ‘Neighbor First Policy’.",,"31 March, 2020",The Diplomatist,Bangladesh Corona Crisis and Governmental Crisis Management Initiatives,
