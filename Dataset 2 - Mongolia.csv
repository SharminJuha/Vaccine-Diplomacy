2022/1001,Article,https://thediplomat.com/2021/05/how-mongolia-made-the-most-of-vaccine-diplomacy/,"Mongolia is ranking high in the global effort to vaccinate populations against COVID-19. As of May 5, 181 countries had started vaccinating their people against the virus, and Mongolia is one of them. According to the Foreign Ministry of Mongolia, 42.2 percent of the population has been vaccinated and 1,398,592 doses have been administered. Mongolia’s multi-pillar foreign policy translated into extremely valuable vaccination diplomacy during a challenging time.

After COVID-19 emerged to become a global pandemic, Mongolia went an astounding 10 months with no local transmission of the virus. But there was a worrying spike this spring, and the country now stands at over 41,000 total cases. According to E-Mongolia, the COVID-19 related death toll has now risen to 134. The increase in infections and the arrival of Mongolians from abroad fostered skepticism of the government’s handling of the overall pandemic.

The Mongolian government’s response has been focused on vaccinating the population while slowly receiving Mongolian citizens from abroad with the assistance of its global partners such as Japan, South Korea, and the United States. But with an array of vaccination options and persistent anti-vaccination sentiments, Mongolians were divided on the issue.

Mongolia’s far-sighted 2011 Foreign Policy Concept calls for a multi-pillar foreign policy approach, and it paid off handsomely in the country’s vaccination diplomacy efforts. Despite its landlocked position, Mongolia managed to utilize its strategic partnerships to receive vaccinations from multiple sources.

According to the Foreign Ministry, Mongolia has received 2,600,540 vaccines through COVAX, the AstraZeneca and Pfizer brands. In addition, the government has purchased Sputnik V from Russia and Sinopharm from China. The COVAX global supply of vaccines to lower-income economies is expected to reach 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.

Mongolia’s strategic partnerships with its neighbors, Russia and China, allowed Mongolia to receive vaccines more quickly compared to other developing countries, many of which are dealing with significant delays. As early as February 23, 2021, Mongolia received 300,000 doses of the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine as a donation from China. More recently, on May 2, Mongolia received the first batch of 20,000 Sputnik V vaccines from Russia and expected to receive an additional 131,200 doses on May 6. Foreign Minister Battsetseg Batmunkh, speaking on national television, stated that the government agencies are diligently “continuing talks to accelerate the vaccination supply.” Moreover, as of April 30, foreign nationals with permanent residency in Mongolia can get their “voluntary vaccination” against COVID-19.

Mongolia’s two large neighbors, Russia and China, have been active in the global supply of vaccines. As the Economic Intelligence Unit reported, “China and Russia have been sending millions of doses of coronavirus vaccines to developing states in recent months. Through this ‘vaccine diplomacy’ operation, Russia and China aim to strengthen their global presence and boost their bilateral relations with the many emerging countries where Western influence is declining.”

But while Mongolia has received neighborly support from both Russia and China, Mongolia’s “third neighbors” weren’t sitting idle either.

The U.S. Embassy in Mongolia reported that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) had launched “a $450,000 (Tugrik 1.3 billion) USAID program to support the Government of Mongolia’s COVID-19 response.” The embassy noted that the new commitment brings the United States’ total COVID-19 aid to Mongolia almost $4 million. “Through this assistance, USAID is focused on helping to strengthen Mongolia’s own ability to fight the disease and to support the following priority areas: infection prevention and control; preparing laboratory systems for large-scale testing; and communicating with the public on steps they can take to prevent and respond to the spread of the virus,” the statement said.

In addition, U.S. Ambassador to Mongolia Michael Klecheski tweeted about his most recent meeting with Battsetseg, writing, “Diplomacy during the pandemic.” The two sides have been in continuous communication on how the United States can support Mongolia’s fight against COVID-19 as a strategic partner, either through COVAX or financial support.

Moreover, on April 26, new Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai received India’s Ambassador to Mongolia M. P. Singh. The Indian government donated 15,000 AstraZeneca vaccine doses to Mongolia in late February 2021, becoming one of the early vaccination donors. Singh stated at the time, “India is glad to be the first nation to provide Covid vaccine to the ‘Spiritual Neighbour’ and ‘Strategic Partner’ Mongolia.” The strategic partnership the two countries established in 2015 is paying dividends during the pandemic. Mongolia was one of 13 countries gifted vaccines in the “very first phase” of India’s vaccine diplomacy, Singh added, saying, “This gesture demonstrates our cooperative and collaborative spirit, our bond of hearts, and the importance of Mongolia in our ‘Act East’ policy.” Now, as India’s COVID-19 numbers break world records, the Mongolian government is donating $1 million to assist India.

Oyun-Erdene, who is approaching the 100 day mark in the prime minister’s office, aims to vaccinate all people above the age of 18, which is 62 percent of the total population, by July of this year. According to the press secretary to the Prime Minister, Bolortuya Chuluunbaatar, “the country needs 4,200,000 doses to fully vaccinate the entire population and [has] currently acquired 2 million vaccinations.”

The global pandemic highlighted the significance of a country’s foreign policy and what can be achieved through strategic foreign policy endeavors and diplomacy. Mongolia, often categorized as a small state due to its 3.2 million population, cannot afford to deal with more deaths. Mongolia is successfully leveraging its long-standing foreign policy pillars to make the most of vaccine diplomacy.",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sizes/medium/thediplomat-2021-02-25-8.jpg,"May 06, 2021",The Diplomat,"How Mongolia Made the Most of Vaccine Diplomacy
Mongolia has received vaccines not only from neighbors China and Russia, but from India and COVAX as well.",
2022/1002,Blog,https://borgenproject.org/covid-19-vaccination-in-mongolia/,"Efforts for COVID-19 vaccination in Mongolia can be described in the oxymoron “small but mighty.” This tiny nation is typically overshadowed by its neighboring states, Russia and China. However, in the event of a pandemic, the position as a small country enclosed by the borders of the world’s two largest vaccine manufacturers can be extremely valuable. Mongolia has benefited greatly from its close ties with its neighbors, powerful forces determined to aid their partners through vaccine diplomacy. As a result of these vaccination efforts, Mongolia hopes to be free of COVID-19 sometime around the Mongolian summer of 2021.

Helpful Partnerships
Mongolia has a sufficient number of vaccines to properly ensure protection within the adult population, primarily due to its advantageous location between China and Russia. The relationship between Mongolia and China dates back to the 1940s when the countries signed a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance. As for Mongolia and Russia, both nations signed the Russo-Mongolian Agreement back in 1912, which gives both countries major commercial advantages. Through these foreign policy agreements, toward the end of April 2021, Mongolia had 1.5 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine from China and 20,000 doses of Sputnik-V vaccines from Russia.

Additionally, on March 24, 2020, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) committed $1.2 million to assist the Mongolian government in its COVID-19 response, according to the U.S. Embassy in Mongolia. USAID is committed to assisting efforts for COVID-19 vaccination in Mongolia by strengthening the country’s disease-fighting capabilities. USAID also supports other critical areas such as “infection prevention and control, preparing laboratory systems for large-scale testing” and public communication on personal preventative measures. Due to aid from Russia, China, the United States and other foreign assistance, as of May 6, 2021, Mongolia has administered more than 1.3 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines.

Vaccination Diplomacy and Foreign Policy
The worldwide pandemic brought into sharp focus the importance of a nation’s foreign policy and what is made possible through efforts of foreign and domestic relations. Mongolia is reaping the benefits of vaccination diplomacy by relying on its well-established foreign policy framework. Mongolia’s COVID-19 vaccine initiative includes COVAX, an international effort aimed at ensuring equal access to COVID-19 vaccinations throughout the world.

Specifically, Mongolia’s foreign minister, Battsetseg Batmunkh, has maintained excellent relationships with Mongolia’s allies. For instance, the U.S. and Mongolia have been in regular contact on how the United States, as a key ally, can help Mongolia tackle COVID-19. Additionally, On February 24, 2021, Batmunkh expressed deep gratitude to the foreign minister of China, Wang Yi, for China’s generous assistance in providing resources to Mongolia to fight COVID-19. Batmunkh also adds that the China-Mongolia relationship sets a good example of how nations around the world can empower one another in the face of adversity.

The Mongolian government is so optimistic about the country’s vaccination rollout that Mongolia is promising citizens a summer free from COVID-19. With a fully vaccinated population of 53.4% as of June 1, 2021, Mongolia is without a doubt at the forefront of the worldwide effort to safeguard communities against COVID-19.",https://borgenproject.org/wp-content/uploads/COVID-19-Vaccination-in-Mongolia.jpg,"July 2, 2021",The Borgen Project,EFFORTS FOR COVID-19 VACCINATION IN MONGOLIA,
2022/1003,Article,https://www.borgenmagazine.com/vaccinations-in-mongolia/,"SEATTLE, Washington — Mongolia is a nation settled between two powerful countries: China and Russia. Known for its rugged terrain and nomadic culture, Mongolia was able to avoid any transmission of COVID-19 cases for ten months. This, however, took a turn in the spring of 2021 with cases rising to numbers that had not yet been seen in the country. With a sudden spike in cases threatening Mongolia’s fragile economy, neighboring countries aided public health efforts in Mongolia by answering the Mongolian government’s call for vaccines. As a result, vaccinations in Mongolia began in earnest.

COVID-19 and its Impact on Mongolia
Mongolian officials were especially wary of their underperforming healthcare system before any cases were even found in Mongolia. In addition, Mongolia also has the world’s longest land border with China. With a steady stream of people crossing the border each day between Mongolia and China, the government of Mongolia had to quickly prioritize protecting its people from the spread of the virus. When Mongolia was finally hit with COVID-19 cases similar to those in other countries, the shock of it greatly impacted the Mongolian labor market structure and shook the economic stability of the country.

The World Bank’s Mongolia Economic Update report showed that low-skilled workers living just above the national poverty line had fallen below the line into poverty because of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their careers. However, by the end of 2021, the report estimates economic growth that will take place due to government stimulus measures will assist impoverished people. Along with this, the introduction of vaccinations in Mongolia will also contribute to economic growth.

Economic Ties: Critical for Vaccine Acquisition
With the country in a state of crisis, the Mongolian foreign minister turned towards China and Russia for help. Because of China’s reliance on Mongolian coal production, Mongolia gained priority in China’s vaccine distribution plan. A donation of 300,000 Sinopharm vaccines was sent from China to Mongolia. Afterward, Mongolia reached an agreement with Russia to purchase one million doses of Russia’s Sputnik vaccine while days later also getting approved for 330,000 more doses of China’s Sinopharm vaccine. China and Russia weren’t the only countries to donate vaccines to Mongolia. Thanks to a strategic partnership formed in 2015, India donated 15,000 AstraZeneca vaccines in February 2021. Because of additional donations from the COVAX initiative and continued national purchasing of vaccines, the number of vaccinations in Mongolia has steadily reached past three million. Mongolia’s ability to grapple with foreign policies for vaccine diplomacy has certainly been demonstrated through its support from other countries and companies.

Looking Forward: Vaccinations in Mongolia
The new Mongolian prime minister, Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai, aims to vaccinate every Mongolian citizen above the age of 18 as soon as possible, previously setting sights on July of 2021 as a possible completion date for the ambitious goal. With only a population of 3.2 million people, the number of citizens above 18 is 62% of the Mongolian population. 3,788,394 individual doses have been administered in Mongolia, which has been estimated to provide the nation with a majority of fully vaccinated citizens. With high numbers of vaccinated citizens, Mongolia hopes to see an upswing in its economic stability.

To prevent significant portions of its citizenship from falling below the poverty line, Mongolia utilized the benefits of alliances with its powerful neighbors, Russia and China, among others. With the acquisition of vaccinations in Mongolia from other countries, the Mongolian economy may be able to recover from the devastating blow COVID-19 caused to its labor force. Moreover, the nation as a whole may be permanently past its peak of cases, which could signal the start of a recovery in every major sector and beyond.",https://www.borgenmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Mongolia-Receiving-COVID-19-Vaccines-from-Russia-and-China-768x513.jpg,"July 3, 2021",Borgen Magazine,"Vaccinations in Mongolia Supported by Russia, China and Alliances",

Khurelsukh asked Wang Yi to convey his sincere greetings to President Xi Jinping, saying that exchanges between Mongolia and China date back to ancient times, and the two countries are always friendly neighbors and tested friends with no political divergence nor unresolved issues. Mongolia firmly pursues the one-China principle and holds that affairs related to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xizang and Xinjiang are China's internal affairs. This is Mongolia's consistent policy, which will never change. Mongolia heartfully admires the great development achievements made by the friendly neighbor under the outstanding leadership of President Xi Jinping, and is glad to see that with the joint efforts of both sides, the important consensus between the two heads of state has been effectively implemented, and the goal of 10-billion-U.S. dollar bilateral trade volume has been reached. Mongolia appreciates China's persistent efforts to share development opportunities with neighboring countries to help Mongolia achieve common development and win-win cooperation. Mongolia is ready to seek greater synergy between the development strategies of the two countries, and deepen cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, ports, infrastructure, and desertification prevention and control, so as to elevate the Mongolia-China comprehensive strategic partnership to a new height. Mongolia looks forward to stepping up exchanges between the Mongolian People's Party and the Communist Party of China (CPC) to usher in a new century of cooperation between the two Parties, both in their 100s. He wishes the 20th National Congress of the CPC a complete success.



Khurelsukh said Mongolia highly appreciates China's pandemic prevention policy, which has not only effectively protected the health and well-being of the 1.4 billion Chinese people, but also made important contributions to global solidarity against COVID-19. He sincerely thanked China for providing Mongolia with many batches of vaccines and other anti-pandemic materials despite its own difficulties. Mongolia speaks highly of China's positive contributions to defending the UN Charter, attaches great importance to the significance of the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative in promoting world peace and security, and will actively support and participate in the two initiatives and deepen synergy and implementation in this regard.

Wang Yi conveyed President Xi Jinping's warm greetings to President Khurelsukh, saying that China and Mongolia are good neighbors more valuable than gold, good brothers sharing joys and sorrows, and good partners going through thick and thin together. The two sides have joined hands to fight the pandemic and gifted one another with sheep and tea, writing a new tale of friendship between the two countries. Following the philosophy of putting people and their lives first, China has protected the lives and health of the Chinese people, and at the same time contributed to the global pandemic response, demonstrating the sense of responsibility as a country with a huge population. China will stay committed to the established policy, respond to COVID-19 and pursue economic and social development in a well-coordinated way, and continue to provide anti-pandemic support for Mongolia as needed to jointly defeat the pandemic and expel the virus. We will continue to carry out all-round mutually beneficial cooperation with Mongolia under the guidance of the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit, and inclusiveness and the principle of upholding justice while pursuing shared interests, both put forward by President Xi Jinping. China will be a major country that makes its neighbors rest assured, provides support and assistance for them, and develops together with them. China is ready to join hands with Mongolia to follow through on the important consensus between the heads of state, work in the direction of jointly building a community with a shared future, and seek greater synergy between the Belt and Road Initiative and the Steppe Road Program, between the Global Development Initiative and Mongolia's New Revival Policy, and between China's ""two-step"" development strategy and Mongolia's long-term development vision, so as to help Mongolia turn its advantages in resources and geographical position into development advantages, and make the development outcomes of China-Mongolia relations better benefit the Mongolian people.

Wang Yi said that China appreciates Mongolia's reaffirmation of its firm support for the one-China principle and its opposition to interference in China's internal affairs. China also supports Mongolia in safeguarding its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and backs Mongolia in pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions. As Chinese people say, ""For our friends, we have fine wine. For jackals or wolves, we welcome with shotguns"". We are ready to work with Mongolia and the vast developing countries to maintain solidarity and cooperation, forge ahead hand in hand, continue to support each other on issues involving respective core interests, jointly safeguard peace and tranquility, and build beautiful homes to benefit future generations.

During Wang Yi's visit to Mongolia, Mongolian Prime Minister Luvsannamsrai Oyun-Erdene and Speaker of the Parliament Gombojav Zandanshatar met with Wang Yi respectively.

On the same day, Wang Yi also held talks with Mongolian Foreign Minister Batmunkh Battsetseg and jointly met the press.

""Strengthening continuously mutually-beneficial cooperation with China is one of the Mongolian foreign policy priorities,"" Battsetseg told Xinhua in a recent interview.

Describing China as Mongolia's eternal neighbor with a long history of traditional relations, she said it's pleasing to see that the comprehensive strategic partnership with China has been deepening in all areas.

Last year, the two countries exchanged high-level visits and held meetings of intergovernmental commissions, maintained trade and economic interactions, and effective cooperation in preventing and curbing the spread of the pandemic, Battsetseg noted.

""We are sincerely grateful to the Chinese government and people for donating vaccines and essential medical equipment to Mongolia during this difficult time, as well as for sharing experiences in successfully combating the pandemic,"" she said, adding that China's vaccine support is very important for Mongolia.

Mongolia launched a national vaccination campaign in late February, aiming to vaccinate at least 60 percent of its 3.3 million population.

So far, over 55 percent of its population have been fully vaccinated, according to the country's health ministry.

""We believe that intensive and wide-ranging immunization will increase economic activity and opportunities for further cooperation with foreign countries, including China,"" said Battsetseg.

In addition, within the framework of long-term and medium-term development policies, Mongolia has set specific goals and started implementing measures to reduce poverty, increase people's incomes, improve quality of life and support business activities, said Battsetseg.

China is one of the country's largest trade and investment partners, Battsetseg said, noting that economic cooperation between Mongolia and China plays an important role in achieving the above-mentioned long-term development policy goals.

China's willingness to share development experiences and benefits with other countries, import more goods and services from abroad and pursue a policy of common development is a good opportunity for neighboring countries such as Mongolia, she said.

Moreover, Mongolia has supported China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) from the onset and actively participated in it, Battsetseg said, expressing her willingness to exchange experiences and implement joint projects with China not only in the real-economy sectors, but also in financial and e-service within the BRI framework.

Commending China's achievements in poverty alleviation, she said that Mongolia is also interested in exchanging experiences and cooperating with China in artificial intelligence, robotics, innovation, environmentally friendly technologies and tourism.

The United States remains committed to supporting the people of Mongolia as they recover from this devastating pandemic. These donations through COVAX are part of that effort.   




Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, The United States has provided nearly USD8 million in support to Mongolia, including USD3.7 million in additional urgent COVID-19 assistance provided in early September 2021. This assistance is providing life-saving medicine, testing kits, urgent medical equipment and supplies, oxygen therapy, and personal protective equipment (PPE).  USAID also provided 50 high-quality ventilators in December 2020 and follow-on training needed to treat critically ill patients.  USAID supports risk communication campaigns, infection prevention and control efforts in health facility and school settings, and vaccine distribution assistance.    



In addition, the United States has provided critical medical equipment for more than 570 medical facilities and helped train nearly 12,700 healthcare workers to conduct outbreak surveillance, use and manage U.S. government-donated medical equipment, and deliver quality care for COVID-19 patients. 



The United States, as Mongolia’s third neighbor, will continue to support the health and wellbeing of the Mongolian people. 





The United States is the largest single country contributor to COVAX. The U.S. government contributed an initial USD2 billion contribution to Gavi in March, which supports procurement and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX.

Without any known pre-existing conditions, he was admitted to the hospital with 95% of his lungs damaged.

“It was getting very hard to breathe…,” said Iderzaya. “I was worried a lot. I was worried about my children and my family.”

Iderzaya was in hospital for 41 days while his lungs were infected with the coronavirus and couldn’t function.

“When I was getting treatment at the reanimation unit, I experienced firsthand the benefits of improved health services in the hospital. The doctors took tests and imaging regularly, using modern mobile equipment by my bedside, so I didn’t have to be moved to other places,” he said.

Iderzaya is now fully recovered. He is convinced that without the doctors and the equipment, his life would have been in danger.

""We are really blessed to have this state-of-the-art equipment in our hospital. It is saving lives. It saved the life of Iderzaya and many other young and old men and women we treated at the hospital since the COVID-19 outbreak. We are glad to have this effective equipment at hand to help our treatment.""

Gearing up ahead of the crisis

Mobile x-rays, ventilators, and other types of equipment were part of the package financed under the World Bank-supported Mongolia COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health Sector Preparedness Project. The project is supporting Mongolia’s emergency needs while also helping the country prepare for future health crises.

“The project was approved in April 2020, when we had no local COVID-19 outbreaks [in Mongolia]. Thanks to acting early, we were able to gear up ahead of the local outbreak,” said Dr. Buyantogtokh, Project Director at the Ministry of Health. “This made a huge difference. When first patients started to get admitted to the hospitals in late 2020, we were already prepared, so the treatment was very effective.”

So far, more than 6,100 units of medical equipment worth over $16 million have been provided to all provincial and district hospitals as well as central hospitals in Ulaanbaatar. This has not only helped the hospitals improve infection prevention control and patient care, but also increased their diagnostic, laboratory, and treatment capacity. The project also supported training for emergency care doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff, as well as infection control measures and public information campaigns. An additional $1 million grant was provided through the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility to help the country supply more than 4 million pieces of personal protective equipment to health care providers and officers at high-risk screening points.

A World Bank-facilitated procurement facility helped ensure the delivery of high-quality equipment amid rising global demand. “The fact that we were able to procure the equipment at a factory price, on a very tight timeline, and amid a global shortage of medical goods is something that we are very satisfied with and proud of,” said J.Bayartogtokh, a procurement specialist of the project.

Safe and effective vaccines for all  

In February 2021, an additional financing of $50.7 million (to an initial $26.9 million) for the project was approved to support fair and affordable access to COVID-19 vaccines, as well as continued response and recovery efforts. The funding supported Mongolia’s nationwide vaccination campaign, which rolled out in early 2021. To date, about 2.2 million people – nearly 70% of the total population – have received their second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Since August 2021, Mongolia has started administering booster shots, as well as vaccines to 12 to 17-year-olds.

“Aging infrastructure had made storing and deploying routine childhood vaccines across the country a challenge,” said Dashpagma, head of the vaccination unit of the National Center for Communicable Diseases (NCCD). “The influx of COVID-19 vaccines for most of the adult population has exacerbated this problem, so we were in urgent need of a comprehensive solution.”

To address aging infrastructure and inadequate vaccine storage capacity, a new Central Storage for Vaccines and Bioproducts was completed in three months with the project financing and opened in August 2021. The vaccine storage facility – four times more spacious than the old facility – was built in accordance with high international standards. The facility is energy-efficient, earthquake resistant, and fully equipped with modern engineering and safety systems to ensure safe and effective deployment. The project has purchased 800 fridges, 34 items of ultra-cold chain equipment, and 10 cold rooms for a total of $2.9 million, which were installed both in the central storage facility and at vaccination units around the country.

""With this new facility, we are proud to say that Mongolia’s vaccine storage and cold chain capacity has entered a new stage. Every single vaccination unit in the country, down to soums and bags, is able to receive properly stored vaccines from the central storage, ensuring that all people, including those living in remote areas, are vaccinated.""

Going beyond health

The World Bank is also helping Mongolia mitigate the worst impacts of the pandemic and achieve better outcomes in education, social protection, governance, and small and medium enterprises. Support for social insurance has provided direct relief for about 120,000 people enrolled in the country’s voluntary plan—including self-employed workers, micro-entrepreneurs, and the informally employed—as well as workers and employers in the formal sector. This helped people cover daily expenses during the crisis while maintaining access to pensions, disability and unemployment benefits, and paid maternity leave. In addition, the World Bank mobilized $5 million through an education project to support the government’s Child Money Program, benefiting more than 1 million children. 

“As a doctor myself, I know that the equipment, vaccines, and training provided have helped to prevent many deaths from COVID-19 and improved medical care for other diseases,” said project lead Kate Mandeville.",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/photos/780x439/2022/feb-1/mongolia-hospital.jpg,"February 14, 2022",World Bank,"Equipment, Vaccine, and Training: Supporting Mongolia’s COVID-19 Response and Recovery",

These doses were delivered through COVAX and came directly from the Pfizer manufacturing plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

This donation brings the total number of COVID vaccine doses donated by the United States to Mongolia to more than 1.4 million. The United States remains committed to supporting the people of Mongolia as they move forward from this devastating pandemic. These donations through COVAX are part of that effort.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States, through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), has provided over $8.1 million in support to Mongolia. This assistance is providing life-saving medicine, testing kits, urgent medical equipment and supplies, oxygen therapy, and personal protective equipment. USAID also provided 50 high-quality ventilators in December 2020 and training for health workers throughout the country on how to manage critically ill patients. USAID supports risk communication campaigns, infection prevention and control efforts in health facility and school settings, and vaccine distribution assistance.

In addition, the United States has provided critical medical equipment for more than 570 medical facilities and helped train nearly 12,700 healthcare workers to conduct outbreak surveillance, use and manage U.S. government-donated medical equipment, and deliver quality care for COVID-19 patients.

The United States, as Mongolia’s third neighbor, will continue to support the health and wellbeing of the Mongolian people.

The United States works with international partners to donate COVID-19 vaccines to the world and end the pandemic. America’s support for the global fight against COVID-19 includes:

Donating over 539 million vaccine doses to other countries.
Purchasing 1 billion vaccine doses to donate to nearly 100 developing countries.
Contributing $4 billion to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, in support of COVAX, the global initiative to equitably distribute safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.
Delivering essential medicines, supplies and therapeutics, as well as other assistance to help countries rebuild economies, overcome food shortages and strengthen health security.
“The United States will be the world’s arsenal of vaccines in our shared fight against this virus,” President Biden said in a June 3, 2021, statement. “We will continue to do all we can to build a world that is safer and more secure against the threat of infectious disease.”",https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/styles/732_width/public/pressreleases/Image-from-iOS-1-1-2048x1366.jpg?itok=Ftycsu_j,"June 18, 2022",USAID,"Mongolia Receives 302,400 Pediatric Doses of Pfizer Vaccine Donated by the United States through COVAX | Press Release | Mongolia | U.S. Agency for International Development",
2022/1015,Article,https://www.csis.org/analysis/china-exploiting-pandemic-advance-its-interests-mixed-results,"The Covid-19 pandemic has offered China an unprecedented opportunity to shore up its international influence by providing the world with much-needed public health goods. The CSIS China Power Project published a detailed study of China’s “Covid-19 diplomacy,” which assesses the scope and impact of China’s efforts to supply countries with medical aid and vaccines. The study developed a unique Chinese Covid-19 Diplomacy Index (CCDI), which brings together thousands of data points to score countries based on the extent to which China engaged them in medical diplomacy and vaccine diplomacy and how receptive they were to Chinese activities. The study and the index generate important insights into the strengths and weaknesses of China’s approach to Covid-19 diplomacy and the implications for the United States and its partners.

Q1: How has China engaged in Covid-19 diplomacy?

A1: Based on the study’s analysis of Chinese activities from January 2020 to the present, there are six main features of Beijing’s Covid-19 diplomacy:

China’s Covid-19 diplomacy is not primarily based on need or reciprocity. Political and strategic calculations—including the desire to strengthen existing relationships and forge new ones—figure prominently in Beijing’s decisions to provide medical aid or vaccines.

China’s provision of medical aid and vaccines has frequently come with strings attached. For example, where possible, Chinese embassies abroad requested that officials in recipient countries provide public displays of gratitude by participating in handover ceremonies to welcome Chinese medical supplies and vaccines. There is also evidence that Beijing paired its provision of vaccines with requests that recipient country governments defend Chinese stances on issues.

Beijing has sought to project the impression that its medical supplies and vaccines were donations. Yet more than 99 percent of China’s exports of personal protective equipment (PPE) in 2020 were sold, not donated, and about 96 percent of its vaccine exports were likewise sold.

While the United States and many other wealthy countries have donated large quantities of vaccines to COVAX (a global initiative to promote equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines), China predominantly engages countries bilaterally in order to augment its bilateral influence. Only about 16 percent of Chinese vaccine exports have been allocated to COVAX or other multilateral mechanisms, and much of this was in the form of sales.

With both medical supplies and vaccines, China has prioritized speed over quality in order to reap first-mover advantages.

China’s Covid-19 diplomacy has been accompanied by aggressive Chinese information and disinformation campaigns—a topic that the China Power team will cover in detail in its next feature.
Q2: Is China succeeding at advancing its interests through Covid-19 diplomacy?

A2: China has had mixed success in advancing its interests through its Covid-19 diplomacy.

The CCDI reveals that China’s activities likely earned Beijing goodwill and influence in several middle-income countries along China’s periphery (such as Kyrgyzstan, Cambodia, Mongolia, and Indonesia), in sub-Saharan Africa (including Comoros, Zimbabwe, and the Republic of Congo), and in Serbia. Two high-income countries—Hungary and Chile—also ranked highly in the CCDI, suggesting China had sizeable influence there.

These findings indicate Chinese activities could have improved Beijing’s image and helped strengthen its relationships with countries that sought, or already enjoyed, strong relationships with China. In some countries, there is some evidence that providing vaccines enabled Beijing to advance its foreign policy objectives. Hungary, for example, blocked EU statements criticizing China in April 2021, just a few weeks after the country purchased millions of doses of Chinese vaccines.

At the same time, there are examples of vaccine diplomacy not winning China foreign policy victories. Amid a painful Covid-19 outbreak, officials in Paraguay publicly toyed with switching official diplomatic ties from Taiwan to mainland China, but authorities in Asunción ultimately chose not to do so. Furthermore, Beijing’s heavy-handed approach may have worsened its relations with some countries, especially wealthy democratic countries.

A major limiting factor in China’s vaccine diplomacy has been Beijing’s preference to sell vaccines and to provide them bilaterally. Most of China’s vaccines have gone to middle-income countries, leaving many of the poorest countries highly vulnerable. This has limited Beijing’s reach and undercut its attempts to cast itself as a benevolent guarantor of global public health.

Finally, the overall impact of China’s vaccine diplomacy has been watered down by concerns about the efficacy and safety of Chinese vaccines. Health authorities in at least 10 countries have suspended the use of Chinese vaccines, recommended pairing them with non-Chinese booster shots, or pushed back on them in some other way due to safety and efficacy concerns. China’s provision of medical supplies was similarly hindered by quality concerns, as some Chinese exported products were found to be fake or counterfeit.

Q3: What are the implications of China’s Covid-19 diplomacy for the United States and its partners?

A3: These findings suggest three main implications for the United States and its allies and partners. First, China did not fully seize the opportunity it had after it contained Covid-19 at home in early 2020. There was tremendous international outpouring of public health aid to China in early 2020 and China did not capitalize on that to strengthen relationships globally. Instead, China’s heavy-handed public diplomacy polarized its relationships with a number of countries. For the international community, Beijing’s response to the pandemic is a lesson learned in how Chinese diplomatic efforts and capabilities may not match, or at times even support, its broader ambitions.

Second, the United States does not necessarily need to compete with China on the provision of vaccines globally or seek to match Chinese vaccines dose-for-dose. Fast and early Chinese exports of its vaccines abroad have neither guaranteed sustained Chinese influence (particularly as other non-Chinese vaccines became available) nor caused China to have outsized and undue influence over recipient countries. Countries respond to what Beijing delivers and they take into account the efficacy of Chinese vaccines. The United States and its allies and partners should focus on ensuring widespread availability of high-quality vaccines based on public health needs.

Third, China’s public health diplomacy is wanting in many ways and has not matched the image that China seeks to project regarding its global health leadership. The United States should encourage China to donate rather than sell more vaccines to countries. It should particularly encourage China to donate more vaccines to COVAX. Finally, Washington should call on China to drop its requests that recipient countries demonstrate public displays of gratitude to China or align themselves with Chinese foreign policy goals.",,"September 30, 2021",Centre for Strategic and International Studies,"China Is Exploiting the Pandemic to Advance Its Interests, with Mixed Results | Center for Strategic and International Studies",
2022/1016,Article,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/20/business/coronavirus-vaccine-mongolia.html,"Mongolia, a country of grassy hills, vast deserts and endless skies, has a population not much bigger than Chicago’s. The small democratic nation is used to living in the shadow of its powerful neighbors, Russia and China.

But during a pandemic, being a small nation sandwiched between two vaccine makers with global ambitions can have advantages.

At a time when most countries are scrambling for coronavirus vaccines, Mongolia now has enough to fully vaccinate its entire adult population, in large part thanks to deals with both China and Russia. Officials are so confident about the nation’s vaccine riches that they are promising citizens a “Covid-free summer.”

Mongolia’s success in procuring the vaccines in the span of a few months is a big victory for a low-income, developing nation. Many poor countries have been waiting in line for shots, hoping for the best. But Mongolia, using its status as a small geopolitical player between Russia and China, was able to snap up doses at a clip similar to that of much wealthier countries.

“It speaks to the Mongolian ability to play to the two great powers and maximize their benefits even while they are on this tightrope between these two countries,” said Theresa Fallon, director of the Center for Russia Europe Asia Studies in Brussels.

It is also a win for China and Russia, which have extensive resource interests in Mongolia and ambitions to appear to play a role in ending the pandemic, even when much of the world has expressed deep skepticism over their homegrown vaccines.

Mongolia is a buffer between eastern Russia, which is resource rich and mostly unpopulated, and China, which is crowded and hungry for resources. While Russia and China are often aligned on the global stage, they have a history of conflict and are wary of each others’ interests in Mongolia. Those suspicions can be seen in their vaccine diplomacy.

“Putin is deeply concerned about what China is doing in their neighborhood,” Ms. Fallon said of Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin.

Russia has sold Mongolia one million doses of its Sputnik V vaccine. China has provided four million doses of vaccine — the final shipment of doses arrived this week. Mongolia’s most recent agreement with China’s Sinopharm Group, which is state-owned, was made days before the company received emergency authorization from the World Health Organization.

Mongolia was late to the global clamber for Covid-19 vaccines. For nearly a year officials boasted that there were no local cases. Then came an outbreak in November. Two months later, political crisis precipitated by the mishandling of the virus led to the sudden resignation of the prime minister. The prospect of continued coronavirus restrictions threatened to throw the country into further political turmoil.

The new prime minister, Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai, pledged to restart the economy, which had suffered from lockdowns and border closures, particularly in the south, where Mongolian truck drivers ferry coal across the border to China’s steel mills. But these plans were complicated by surging cases, with the daily count going from hundreds a day to thousands.

“We were quite desperate,” said Bolormaa Enkhbat, an economic and development policy adviser to the prime minister.

Mongolia approached China and Russia first, the foreign minister said, hoping longstanding economic ties with each country would help move it to the front of the line of countries seeking vaccines. Officials simultaneously explored diplomatic and private channels — putting in requests for donations from rich countries and the world’s biggest vaccine manufacturers.

They contacted price-gouging middlemen, international health organizations and vaccine alliances for poorer countries. One intermediary offered to sell Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid vaccine for $120 a shot, nearly a quarter of the average monthly salary, Ms. Enkhbat said. Covax, the global vaccine-sharing alliance, which Mongolia signed onto in July 2020, promised doses in the fall or winter.

With each breakthrough from Russia, negotiations moved more quickly with China.

In early February, Mongolia approved Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. Three days later, China’s Sinopharm Group received approval for its Vero Cell vaccine. Soon after, China donated 300,000 doses of its Sinopharm vaccine to Mongolia, citing a “profound traditional friendship” as motivation.

Opening up more of the border between China and Mongolia was also a part of the vaccine discussions, Chinese and Mongolian officials said in Chinese state media. Mongolia needs China to buy its coal — exports to the country make up nearly a quarter of Mongolia’s annual economic growth. The revenues helped to pad Mongolia’s budget by a quarter last year.

After a month of back and forth, the Mongolian government struck a deal in March with Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, too, for one million doses of the Sputnik vaccine. Days later, Mongolia finalized an agreement to buy 330,000 additional doses of the Sinopharm vaccine.

When there was a last-minute hitch in the delivery of the purchased Chinese vaccines, a call on April 7 between China’s premier, Li Keqiang, and Mongolia’s prime minister, helped to smooth things over and reassure both sides. Up to that point, it was still unclear if Mongolia would be able to rely on China or if it would need to return to Russia for more vaccines.

“That’s what paved the way for the rest of the deal,” Ms. Enkhbat said about the phone call between the two men. “We laid out the situation and said that we are betting on Chinese vaccines at a time when the rest of the world fully isn’t.”

Mongolia has also secured commitments from AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech. So far it has received only 60,000 of the Sputnik vaccine because of manufacturing delays. But the Chinese vaccine will account for a majority of Covid-19 shots for Mongolia’s population.

“We are thankful to our partners, especially China, that they are providing us with vaccinations when they also need it for domestic use,” said Battsetseg Batmunkh, Mongolia’s foreign minister.

The Chinese and Russian embassies in Mongolia did not respond to requests for comment.

In Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia’s capital, 97 percent of the adult population has received a first dose and more than half are fully vaccinated, according to government statistics. Across the country, more than three quarters of Mongolians have already received one shot.

The country’s vaccination effort still faces hurdles. Mongolia is economically dependent on China, and many of its citizens continue to fear its power and influence. When tensions have arisen in the past, China has shut its border and stopped purchasing Mongolian coal.

Mongolians have also expressed a preference for Russia’s Sputnik vaccine. To get the population to take the Sinopharm shot, the government has offered each citizen 50,000 tugriks — about $18 — to get fully vaccinated. The average monthly salary in 2020 was $460.

The terms and pricing of the Sinopharm and Sputnik deals were not made public, and Mongolia’s foreign ministry declined to comment on pricing. Representatives for the Gamaleya Research Institute and Sinopharm did not respond to requests for comment.

While some global health experts have questioned whether Sinopharm will be able to continue to deliver on its commitments overseas, it has delivered all of the doses Mongolia ordered. China has said it can make as many as five billion doses by the end of the year, though officials have warned that the country is struggling to make enough shots for its citizens.

There are also some signs that governments that have chosen the Sinopharm vaccine may have to roll out a third booster shot sooner than expected.

China, for its part, may be playing a long game, said Julian Dierkes, an associate professor at the University of British Columbia who specializes in Mongolian politics. Though many Mongolians may still not trust China, the Mongolian government will remember how it made its vaccines available at a critical moment.

“We could coin a phrase here: ‘The opportunity of smallness,’” he said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/05/13/business/00Virus-Mongolia1/merlin_187693854_bb14aeba-d0b6-4a4c-918d-9fb133e1e34d-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp,"May 20, 2021",New York TImes,Countries Are Scrambling for Vaccines. Mongolia Has Plenty. - The New York Times,
2022/1017,Article,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/warrior-spirit-sheep-diplomacy-mongolia-sprinting-ahead-vaccine/,"Mongolia is a small player on the international stage, best known for its expansive, rugged landscapes and nomadic culture. 

But amid a frantic global scramble for vaccines, the sparsely populated nation has become the latest – and perhaps most surprising – member of an elusive club: those with plenty of shots. 

According to the latest government data, 88 per cent of Mongolia’s adult population has had their first vaccine, while 40 per cent have been given two. In the capital city, Ulaanbaatar, nearly 99 per cent of adults have had at least one jab – and there are no signs the country will soon exhaust its supply. 

Like other smaller, not necessarily wealthy, countries that have seen success – notably Bhutan and Serbia – Mongolia has exploited close relationships with its neighbours, superpowers that are keen to further their own aims through ‘vaccine diplomacy’. 

Though India sent a donation of roughly 150,000 AstraZeneca vaccines in late February and close to 100,000 have arrived through the Covax distribution scheme, the bulk of roughly 4.3 million doses so far have come from China and Russia.  

“We were very aware of our relationships with our neighbours and wanted to utilise that,” Bolormaa Enkhbat, an economic and development policy adviser to the Mongolian prime minister, told The Telegraph. 


“But that wasn’t easy, just to get in line is quite difficult,” she said, describing a series of relentless calls and meetings driven by the country’s relatively new Prime Minister, Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai, and his ambassadors abroad. 

“Mongolians [have] this very warrior-like spirit,” Ms Enkhbat added. “You know, a ‘we want to get this done and we’re going to get this done’ type of attitude.”

That persistence has paid off. The government has struck a deal for a million Sputnik V vaccines, though just 60,000 have so far arrived from Russia due to challenges ramping up manufacturing capacity.

But last week, the final shipment of four million shots arrived from China’s state owned Sinopharm, which has formed the backbone of Mongolia’s supply. That should be enough to cover its adult population, which numbers almost 2.1 million, according to the government.

Academics including Oyunsuren Damdinsuren, from the school of international relations at the National University of Mongolia, credit what President Khaltmaagiin Battulga calls “sheep diplomacy” for this foreign policy win.

“He was the first foreign head of state to visit China after the pandemic had started in Wuhan, and donated 30,000 sheep as humanitarian assistance,” she told The Telegraph. “[This] paved the way to receive 300,000 doses of Sinopharm vaccine as a donation and further secure purchases of additional vaccines.” 

But Mongolia’s coronavirus response has not all been plain sailing. While the country managed to remain Covid free for 10 months – in part due to stringent border controls which prevented even Mongolian nationals from entering – the virus arrived in November.

The resulting restrictions toppled the former Prime Minister – Mongolia has a presidential head of state with the prime minister holding executive power – who resigned amid widespread protests in January. 

His replacement, Mr Oyun-Erdene, has made vaccinations a key pillar of his strategy to end lockdown measures. But in March the country saw its largest surge in cases yet, amid large public events and concerts to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Mongolian People’s Party. 

“Leaders and artists did not wear masks,” said Prof Damdinsuren. “Their photos and footage without masks sent a wrong message to the public and a false sense of security.”


Once the virus was circulating, she added, it spread rapidly through cities on overcrowded public transport – cases peaked at around 2,500 a day in late April, up from an average of only around 40 new infections per day throughout February. 

Cases in the wider country, among the nomadic population – which makes up around 30 per cent of the populace – have remained, like the people themselves, few and far between. 

But the urban surge made vaccination an urgent priority. The rollout began first in Ulaanbaatar, which is home to roughly half of Mongolia’s population. The country’s approach has also bucked the global trend, prioritising younger groups rather than the old and vulnerable, in a bid to control transmission and curb the surge. 

And while Ms Enkhbat said there is no widespread anti-vaccination movement, trust in China’s vaccine has been lower. This is especially true among the older generation, who grew up at a time when Mongolia and the Soviet Union were strong allies, and wanted to wait for Sputnik V. 

In an attempt to encourage vaccinations, the government introduced a policy to pay 50,000 Mongolian Tugriks (MNT), roughly £13, to people after their second jab – the average monthly salary in 2020 was around £320. 

And while Sinopharm is free for all, those under 65 must pay around 120,000 MNT (£30) for Sputnik at a private hospital. Some sports facilities, like gyms and swimming pools, are only allowing fully vaccinated people.

Reaching those living nomadic lifestyles in remote regions may be a trickier task. Mongolia is the least densely populated country on the globe, with hundreds of thousands of herders living isolated lifestyles in the rugged countryside. 

Ms Enkhbat is confident that the health infrastructure already exists to reach this group. Mobile vaccine centres are already deployed and the first Covax deliveries reached rural Batsumber, a division of Tov province in the north of the country, last week. Yet others are less convinced.

“Around half live in the capital area, the remaining half live over the next 1,500 kilometres,” said Professor Troy Sternberg, a professor at the University of Oxford who has studied the impact of Covid-19 on Mongolia’s pastoralists. “I really wonder how they will be able to vaccinate this rural population – it’s so remote.” 

But, as it stands, the government is so confident the worst of the pandemic is over it is promising citizens a “Covid-free summer” and discussing strategies to reopen, by allowing fully vaccinated travellers to visit.

2022/1018,Report,https://reliefweb.int/report/mongolia/usaid-rolls-out-us-government-facilitated-pediatric-covid-19-vaccines-worldwide,"On June 18 and 19, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in collaboration with COVAX, delivered the first two U.S.-facilitated shipments of Pfizer’s pediatric COVID-19 vaccines to Mongolia (302,400 doses) and Nepal (2.2 million doses). These pediatric vaccines are part of President Biden’s commitment to donate COVID-19 vaccine doses to countries around the world.

During the second Global COVID-19 Summit in May, the U.S. announced our commitment to expand our dose donation types to include boosters and pediatric doses to accelerate global vaccine coverage and meet partner countries’ demand for pediatric doses to vaccinate 5 to 11 year-olds. In collaboration with COVAX, USAID will now continue to ship pediatric doses to partner countries around the world that have requested them.

USAID supports countries to address the public health impacts of COVID-19 by reaching high vaccination coverage among the most at-risk populations (i.e. health workers, the elderly, and immunocompromised people) first. Given the ready availability of global COVID-19 vaccine supply, USAID is working with interested partner countries to expand vaccination to additional groups, including children.

Expanding vaccination to children can present countries with opportunities to reach higher risk populations, such as grandparents; increase community acceptance; and contribute to positive norms for COVID-19 vaccination uptake.

In addition to supporting pediatric COVID-19 vaccines, USAID continues its decades-long commitment to support essential immunization to protect children against vaccine-preventable diseases.",,21 Jun 2022,Reliefweb,USAID Rolls Out U.S. Government-Facilitated Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccines Worldwide - Mongolia | ReliefWeb,

OBJECTIVE
The Project’s objective is to increase availability of the eligible vaccines for the priority population, as defined by the Government of Mongolia in its National Deployment and Vaccination Plan.

DESCRIPTION
The Project is proposed to be supported under the COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility (the Facility) of AIIB and co-financed with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) under the ADB’s Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX).

The Project will provide the Government of Mongolia (GOM) with immediate financing support to purchase safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 through APVAX. Through providing timely access to eligible COVID-19 vaccines, the Project will help contribute to containment of the pandemic and supporting economic and social recovery in the country.

The GOM has launched its COVID-19 Vaccination Program and developed the National Deployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP). The NDVP is an integral part of Mongolia's overall national COVID-19 pandemic prevention and response strategic plan. The NDVP ultimately aims to vaccinate 60% of the population. The Project will support the government in direct procurement of APVAX-eligible vaccines from manufacturers as well as international logistics to Mongolia. The Project will support the implementation of the NDVP and contribute to the government's efforts to immunize at least 30% of the population.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL INFORMATION
The loan will be co-financed with ADB as lead co-financier, and the project’s environmental and social (ES) risks and impacts have been assessed in accordance with ADB’s Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS). To ensure a harmonized approach to addressing the ES risks and impacts of the project, and as permitted under AIIB’s Environmental and Social Policy (ESP), ADB’s SPS will apply to the project in lieu of AIIB’s ESP. AIIB has reviewed ADB’s SPS and is satisfied that: (a) it is consistent with AIIB’s Articles of Agreement and materially consistent with the provisions of AIIB’s ESP, including the Environmental and Social Exclusion List (ESEL) and the relevant Environmental and Social Standards (ESSs); and (b) the monitoring procedures that are in place are appropriate for the project.

ADB has categorized the ES risks of the project as Category C for Environment, C for Involuntary Resettlement and C for Indigenous Peoples (which are equivalent to Category C if AIIB’s ESP were applicable) on the basis that no adverse ES impacts are expected. The program is categorized as “some gender elements” by ADB as the project will significantly benefit women and children by providing access to COVID-19 vaccinations.",,"May 19, 2021",Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,Mongolia: Support for COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery in Mongolia under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility - Projects - AIIB,

Mongolia secures nearly 70% vaccination rates and an overall casualty rate of only 0.3%
Successes against COVID-19 position country well for ambitious and progressive reforms as part of government's Vision 2050 agenda
ULAANBAATAR, Mongolia, Dec. 3, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Mongolia is preparing to build on the success of its COVID-19 management policies with an ambitious new budget and progressive initiatives as part of its Vision 2050 reform agenda.

Mongolia's vaccination and booster programme has so far resulted in 66% of the total population, including 91% of adults, being doubled-vaccinated and 21% of the total population, including 35% of adults, receiving their booster.  Supported by responsible public health policies, the country is seeing a steady decline in infections. Daily cases in November were down 70% from September and October, falling below 150 per day at the end of the month, with an overall case fatality rate of only 0.3%.

According to the Worldometer reference website, Mongolia ranked 39th out of 224 nations for total cases per million people as of 1 December.  Furthermore, the government's decision in June to increase the number of hospital beds available for COVID-19 patients to 23,000 enabled it to hospitalise 27% of its cases, including those at risk of developing severe symptoms, helping reduce the number of fatalities.

These and other steps against COVID-19, which also include a wide ranging MNT 10 trillion (US$3.5 billion) stimulus package credited with saving over 280,000 jobs, have left Mongolia well placed to move past the challenges of the pandemic. The country now looks set to begin realising its Vision 2050 agenda, the long-term development plan introduced by new Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai. As Mongolia marks 100 years of political independence, following the 1921 Mongolian Revolution, Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene has positioned Vision 2050 as a chance for Mongolia to achieve economic independence with a diversified economy, improved governance, green development, and improved quality of life among other goals.

Implementing Vision 2050's wide-ranging policies for Mongolia's economic and social development also received a boost in November with the ratification of Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene's 2022 budget, which shows a spending increase of 4 trillion MNT ($US1.4 billion) over 2021.",,"Dec 03, 2021",Prnewswire,Mongolian Government To Build On COVID-19 Vaccine And Booster Success,

2022/1022,Article,https://www.policyforum.net/mongolias-path-to-economic-revival/,"Mongolia’s government has announced a ‘comprehensive’ plan to help its economy rebound from the shock of the pandemic, but it contains no policies designed specifically to reduce poverty, Ariun-Erdene Bayarjargal writes.

Though pandemics do not ‘die’, COVID-19 is likely to fade away from central focus in 2022. As the world transitions into post-pandemic life and into a new normal, policymakers are now looking at recovery options for economies hit hard by the pandemic. Mongolia is no exception.

Mongolia’s economy contracted by 5.3 per cent in 2020, the largest decline in last two decades, but a strong return on exports helped the economy to rebound in the first half of 2021.

High commodity prices, particularly of mining products, in the world market led to a positive balance of trade despite raw volume of exports decreasing. The International Monetary Fund’s Mongolia outlook indicates growth is expected to be 7.5 per cent in 2022.

Alongside this expectation of strong growth, though, is inflation. Supply-chain disruption induced by border closures caused annual inflation to reach 13.4 per cent as of December last year, and hikes in food and fuel prices have also contributed to inflation.

Consequently, the Bank of Mongolia has shifted to a tighter monetary policy, raising its policy rate by 0.5 points from its historic low level of six per cent at the end of January and increasing reserve requirements.

In terms of vaccines, the government of Mongolia managed to secure vaccines for its population by taking an advantage of its proximity to two large vaccine-producing countries in China and Russia.

By the end of January 2022, over 60 per cent of the adult population had received at least one dose of a vaccine. However this vaccination rate, which is among the highest for lower-middle income countries, has not translated into socio-economic normality, and difficult economic conditions continue to affect the livelihoods of many Mongolians.

More on this:Podcast: The future of work in the wake of COVID-19
Like many other countries, in 2020 the government adopted a generous set of fiscal measures to ease the impact of the pandemic on households. These steps included quintupling child allowance money, doubling food stamp allowance, and substantially raising social welfare payments for the vulnerable.

The total size of the package including tax exemptions and support to small and medium businesses reached 7.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in total by August 2020.

Further lockdowns caused income losses to households and firms in 2021, and the government continued the relief package by distributing a cash handout of 300 thousand Mongolian Tögrög (US$104) to every citizen, costing the budget equivalent to 2.5 per cent of the country’s GDP.

Overall, 2.4 million people received social assistance, with child allowance money making up 49.6 per cent of assistance received. Of households affected by economic shocks related to COVID-19 pandemic, those employed in low-skilled and/or informal sectors, those with limited economic security, and those living just above the national poverty line were disproportionately impacted and remain at a high risk of falling into poverty.

One micro-simulation analysis by the World Bank indicates the poverty rate could have increased between 5.4 and 7.9 percentage points compared to the pre-COVID-19 projections in the absence of the government’s mitigation policy.

Although these relief programs helped many households retain their income, their rapid withdrawal could create significant difficulties in the wake of increasing inflation. The challenge Mongolia faces now is that it has limited fiscal capacity but must continue supporting its people as the economy recovers. On top of this, further expansionary fiscal policy could lead to currency pressures, exacerbating inflation.

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the structure and conditions of Mongolia’s labour market. The country’s labour force participation rate is more than two percentage points below 2019 levels as of the third quarter of 2021.

More on this:India’s road to recovery
The service sector, which employs the largest share of workers on casual basis of any industry, was hit hard by the pandemic and the recovery has been slow due to mobility restrictions. Job losses were inevitable in a sector where workers were mostly ineligible for social security payments and other benefits, like paid leave.

This has made marginal income losses even larger among the poor. Women were affected disproportionately too, as they make up the majority of workforce in the service sector, and many were forced out of the labour force to care for children during lockdowns.

Studies have shown that the poor are more vulnerable to unemployment and inflation shocks than the rich, and Mongolia’s situation is no different. There is no doubt the pandemic has exacerbated the vulnerability of certain groups and widened inequality in the country.

Mongolia, like other countries, is shifting from policies focused on short-term economic relief towards accelerating recovery and building resilience. The parliament of Mongolia announced its plan, dubbed the ‘New Revival Policy’, at the end of December 2021, in addition to a four-year plan approved by the government in February 2021.

It focuses on medium-term development issues and outlines improving labour force participation, but it contains a glaring omission – a concrete plan for reducing poverty.

The ‘comprehensive plan’ will cost roughly $3.4 billion, or approximately a quarter of the country’s 2020 GDP in current prices.

The New Revival Policy is on top of this plan and extends this amount to more than $30 billion in the long run. With the government’s yearly revenue in 2021 reaching only $5 billion, it is not at all certain where the fiscal space to finance these programs is coming from in the long term.

While the plan does address issues related to improving youth employment and skills development, along with supporting small and medium businesses, it isn’t acceptable for there to be no specific action outlined for tackling poverty and inequality.

Of course, the government must adopt an integrated and fiscally viable approach to boost medium-term economic prospects and job creation, but it also needs to take specific action to tackle the socio-economic issues facing the Mongolian people, and poverty and inequality are the biggest of these problems.",,21 February 2022,Policyforum,Mongolia’s path to economic revival - Policy Forum,

The funding has been approved at a crucial juncture in the government’s response to COVID-19. Mongolia has taken strong measures to prevent and contain the COVID-19 outbreak since the beginning of 2020. Despite the relatively low number of cases in Mongolia, further community spread risks remain high. To reduce this risk, further preventive measures, supporting health system improvements, and providing access to COVID-19 vaccines are critical.

 

To support the Mongolian government’s strategy to vaccinate at least 60 percent of its population, the additional financing will help pay for purchase and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines. Given the urgent need to expand immunization capacity, it will support comprehensive measures for effective vaccine delivery, such as cold chain upgrade, logistics, national and local roll-out plans, public information campaigns, and staff training.

 

“Access to safe and effective vaccines will be critical to protecting lives and accelerating economic and social recovery in Mongolia,” said Andrei Mikhnev, World Bank Country Manager for Mongolia. “This additional financing approved today will enable affordable and equitable access to vaccines and play a critical role in further strengthening the health system in Mongolia.”

 

The World Bank is part of multilateral efforts such as ACT-A and COVAX and is cooperating closely with WHO and UNICEF who continue to play an integral role in supporting vaccine deployment and building capacity of health care workers.

 

The Mongolia COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Project, approved in April 2020, is helping strengthen health system preparedness and diagnostic capacity through procurement of essential medical equipment and personal protective equipment for three tertiary hospitals as well as hospitals of 21 provinces and 9 districts of Ulaanbaatar city.

Sputnik V is one of the leading vaccines in the world and the number of registrations of the vaccine keeps growing day by day.”



Sputnik V has a number of key advantages:



Efficacy of Sputnik V is 91.6% as confirmed by the data published in the Lancet, one of the world's oldest and most respected medical journals; it is one of only three vaccines in the world with efficacy of over 90%; Sputnik V provides full protection against severe cases of COVID-19.
The Sputnik V vaccine is based on a proven and well-studied platform of human adenoviral vectors, which cause the common cold and have been around for thousands of years.
Sputnik V uses two different vectors for the two shots in a course of vaccination, providing immunity with a longer duration than vaccines using the same delivery mechanism for both shots.
The safety, efficacy and lack of negative long-term effects of adenoviral vaccines have been proven by more than 250 clinical studies over two decades.
The developers of the Sputnik V vaccine are working collaboratively with AstraZeneca on a joint clinical trial to improve the efficacy of AstraZeneca vaccine.
There are no strong allergies caused by Sputnik V.
The storage temperature of Sputnik V at +2+8 C means it can be stored in a conventional refrigerator without any need to invest in additional cold-chain infrastructure.
The price of Sputnik V is less than $10 per shot, making it affordable around the world.",https://www.montsame.mn/files/60235381532ba.jpeg,2021-02-10,Montsame,Mongolia approves Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19,

Third, China supports relevant companies in exporting vaccines to countries in urgent need that have approved Chinese vaccines and authorized their emergency use. For instance, Serbia has started vaccination with recently imported Chinese-made vaccines. More and more countries are approving the domestic use of Chinese vaccines.



The whole world needs to pull together in order to defeat the pandemic. China will continue to provide in a timely manner, to the best of its capability, vaccines to relevant countries, especially the developing countries, and contribute its share to building a global community of health for all.

The project is part of ADB’s USD 9 billion Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX), which was launched in December 2020 to offer rapid and equitable vaccine-related support to ADB’s developing member countries.

“COVID-19 has caused considerable disruption to Mongolia’s health, well-being, and economy,” said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa. “ADB’s APVAX support will provide the Government of Mongolia with immediate and flexible financing to vaccinate priority populations, especially those at highest risk from infection, to reduce the impacts of the disease and help put the country on a path to sustained recovery.”

As COVID-19 emerged at the start of 2020, Mongolia responded quickly to avoid the rapid spread of the disease. However, community transmission emerged in November 2020, straining the health system’s capacity. The economy was hard hit, shrinking by 5.3% in 2020, with official job losses reaching 63,900 or 5.4% of total employment. It is expected that COVID-19 will significantly increase the poverty rate from its level of 28.4% in 2018.

In addition, the crisis has led to increased gender-based violence, with the number of calls to hotlines and women requiring shelter services rising significantly.

The Support for COVID-19 Vaccine Delivery in Mongolia under APVAX will procure vaccines to contribute to the government’s efforts to immunize at least 30% of the population, representing priority populations as defined under Mongolia’s National Deployment and Vaccination Plan. These include individuals at high risk of death from COVID-19 infection and about 200,000 frontline workers. In addition, people with disabilities, those who suffer from chronic diseases, and vulnerable groups requiring social assistance will benefit from the vaccine rollout.

ADB Country Director for Mongolia Pavit Ramachandran and Mongolia’s Minister of Finance and ADB Governor Javkhlan Bold signed the loan agreements immediately after the project approval.

Accordingly, the National Committee for Immunization and Human Drug Council have convened and registered three main vaccines released worldwide -- ‘Pfizer and BioNTech,’ ‘AstraZeneca’ and ‘Moderna’ in the Mongolian drug registry,” reported Minister of Health T.Munkhsaikhan during his press briefing yesterday, January 10.


“Mongolia has an Immunization Law. Our country has an opportunity to immunize the entire population with vaccines registered by the World Health Organization and countries with strict drug regulations.”

2022/1053,News,https://www.montsame.mn/en/read/246745,"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has launched a $9 billion vaccine initiative—the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX)—offering rapid and equitable support to its developing members as they procure and deliver effective and safe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines.

 

“As ADB’s developing members prepare to vaccinate their people as soon as possible, they need financing to procure vaccines as well as appropriate plans and knowledge to be able to safely, equitably, and efficiently manage the vaccination process,” said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa. “APVAX will play a critical role in helping our developing members meet these challenges, overcome the pandemic, and focus on economic recovery.”

 

More than 14.3 million positive cases have been identified in Asia and the Pacific, causing more than 200,000 deaths. As the pandemic persists, economic growth in developing Asia is projected to contract by 0.4% in 2020—the first regional gross domestic product contraction since the early 1960s.

 

Promoting safe, equitable, and effective access to vaccines is a top priority for ADB’s COVID-19 response efforts. Vaccination programs can break the chain of virus transmission, save lives, and mitigate the negative economic impacts of the pandemic by restoring confidence in people’s ability to work, travel, and socialize safely.

 

The APVAX provides a comprehensive framework and resource envelope for supporting developing Asia’s vaccine access, using two complementary components. The Rapid Response Component will provide timely support for critical vaccine diagnostics, procurement of vaccines, and transporting vaccines from the place of purchase to ADB’s developing members.

 

The Project Investment Component will support investments in systems for successful distribution, delivery, and administration of vaccines along with associated investments in building capacity, community outreach, and surveillance. This may include such areas as cold-chain storage and transportation, vehicles, distribution infrastructure, processing facilities, and other physical investments. The component may also be used to develop or expand vaccine manufacturing capacity in developing members.

 

ADB financing for vaccines will be provided in close coordination with other development partners including the World Bank Group, World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX), GAVI, and bilateral and multilateral partners.

 

APVAX promotes safe and effective vaccines to be accessed in a fair manner. For a vaccine to be eligible for financing, it must meet one of three criteria. It must be procured via COVAX, prequalified by WHO, or authorized by a Stringent Regulatory Authority. Additional access criteria, such as a vaccination needs assessment, a vaccine allocation plan by the developing member, and a mechanism for effective coordination among development partners also help ensure that vaccine support under APVAX can be fairly and effectively implemented.

 

ADB is also making available a $500 million Vaccine Import Facility to support the efforts of its developing members to secure safe and effective vaccines, as well as the goods that support distribution and inoculation. The facility is part of ADB’s Trade and Supply Chain Finance Program. AAA-guarantees available through the program’s vaccine import facility will mitigate payment risks and facilitate import of these goods. This will employ the same eligibility criteria on vaccines as COVAX. Cofinancing with private sector partners could result in the Import Facility supporting $1 billion in vaccine and related imports within a year.

 

In April, ADB approved a $20 billion package to support its developing members in addressing the impacts of the pandemic and streamlined some procedures to deliver quicker and more flexible assistance. ADB has committed $14.9 billion in loans, grants, and technical assistance, including $9.9 billion in quick-disbursing budget support from the COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO) and support for the private sector.

 

In November, ADB announced $20.3 million in additional technical assistance to establish systems to enable efficient and equitable distribution of vaccines across Asia and the Pacific.

The funds will be available for ADB developing members to support vaccine-related health system assessments and the development of country readiness plans to strengthen the capacity to access, introduce, deploy, deliver, and monitor vaccines safely and effectively. Funds will help members assess and strengthen vaccine cold chain and logistics, infection control, supply and skills of health workers, risk communications, and real-time data capturing and monitoring. The technical assistance will also support the identification and promotion of innovative cold chain and vaccine tracking technologies. 



“Asia and the Pacific has largely done well to limit the spread of COVID-19. Ensuring access to a safe, effective, and equitable vaccine is the next frontier in the fight against this virus,” said Director General of ADB’s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department Woochong Um. “With these additional grant resources, ADB can immediately support our developing members to undertake urgent actions, including vaccine system assessments and vaccine deployment strategies, to ensure vaccines are delivered efficiently and fairly.”



ADB expects to implement the technical assistance with its partners UNICEF and the World Health Organization, in coordination with COVAX, Gavi, the World Bank, bilateral agencies, among others.



The funds comprise $20 million from ADB’s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) and $300,000 from the High-Level Technology Fund financed by the Government of Japan.

Prime Minister L.Oyun-Erdene first became acquainted with the operations of the Central Storage for Vaccine and Biopreparations at the National Center for Communicable Diseases. Previously, the center had a single storage facility with a capacity of storing 600 thousand doses of vaccines. Thus, at the request of the Government of Mongolia, the construction of a new facility for the Central Storage for Vaccine and Biopreparations was carried out and completed in three months through the ‘COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Project’ being implemented by the World Bank and in the framework of the technical assistance provided by UNICEF. 



With a total area of 1,686 square meters, the new storage facility is designed to store COVID-19 and routine vaccines. Alongside being equipped with modern advanced technology and solutions, the facility is energy efficient and fully meets international safety standards. 

 



 

Resilient against earthquakes up to 8.0 magnitude, the facility’s blueprints were jointly developed by ‘Tatakh Khuch’ and ‘Urnul Project’ LLC, while its construction was carried out by ‘Moncon Construction’ LLC. Furthermore, the installation of the storage equipment was done by ‘Setunari’ LLC, with UNICEF leading the construction project in general.  





 

With the new storage facility put into operation, it becomes possible for Mongolia to receive the necessary amount of COVID-19 and routine vaccines as well as its corresponding medical tools for the country’s total population, to correctly store them as per the standards, and to transport and distribute vaccines nationwide. 





 

Throughout the years, UNICEF has provided consistent support to Mongolia such as support and assistance for the supply of routine vaccines and the protection of maternal and child health as well as public health. The previously-used storage facility was also built with technical and financial support from UNICEF in 2008. 

 



 

With the new facility of the Central Storage for Vaccine and Biopreparations, it has now become possible to receive a minimum of 2-3 million doses of vaccines at once and keep a supply of temperature-sensitive vaccines at various temperature settings such as +2 to +8°C, -15 to -25°C, and -70 to -80°C.

Mr. Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai was appointed as the Prime Minister of Mongolia on January 27 this year. Then, the Government was fully formed as members of his cabinet took an oath of office to the Parliament on January 29. Afterward, Prime Minister L. Oyun-Erdene presented four key objectives of his Cabinet and started working accordingly.




All governments are facing a lot of challenges to recover economy, protect the health of the population and overcome the COVID-19 pandemic with minimum losses. The new government formed in January in Mongolia faced the challenges too. According to the researchers’ estimation, the COVID-19 pandemic caused three times as much economic difficulty as during the 2009 global financial crisis. Mongolia had prevented the spread of the COVID-19 among the community for ten months, but at last, we could not avoid this suffering. Vaccination of the population is greatly significant to overcome the pandemic. The Government considered that the prompt mass vaccination will create a possibility to reopen businesses and revitalize the economy. Therefore, the government set a goal to vaccinate about 2 million adult population of Mongolia and commenced a vaccine rollout officially on February 23 this year. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine started being administered to children aged 16 and above on a voluntary basis since June 15 and children aged 12-15 from June 28 under the parental and guardian consent.




As of today, 2,218,058 people of Mongolia have received the first dose of Verocell, Sputnik-V, AstraZeneca and Pfizer BioNTech vaccines against coronavirus. Of them, 2,022,529 have gotten their second shots, raising the country’s vaccination rate to 62 percent. It means that Mongolia is placed 12th in the world with its percentage of fully vaccination population.   



To curb the spread of the pandemic, the Government imposed the strict lockdown measures on February 11-23 and April 10-25, which was then extended until May 8. During the lockdown, a one-time grant of MNT 300 thousand was given to each citizen in order to intensify the immunization work, prevent financial difficulties and protect the income of households. With aims to intensify vaccine rollout, every fully-vaccinated person was given a bonus of MNT 50 thousand as a support for health, which became an effective step to financially support the citizens who had been in quarantine for months.




As the vaccine rollout was intensified amid the strict lockdown, traffic movement in-and-out of Ulaanbaatar city was reopened from May 20, with relevant regulations issued two days later, which allowed those stranded in the city to return homes.



Mongolia officially reopened its borders starting from June 1, which has allowed Mongolian citizens to travel to more than 10 countries whose borders are currently open to foreign passengers, including Turkey, U.S., United Arab Emirates, Greece, Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil, Egypt and India. 



However, as a measure to prevent from COVID-19 infections, the Government made a decision to postpone this year’s National Naadam Festival. Despite the earlier plans to organize the event without the audience, the Ministry of Health and scholars made the conclusion that it would gather some 12,000 people, creating the risk for about 3,000 people to become infected. Thus, in support of the State Emergency Commission’s suggestion, the Cabinet decided to postpone the event until next year.
